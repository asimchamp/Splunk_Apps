RedAlert
extends
the alerting capabilities of Splunk by providing a simplified and
comprehensive configuration interface for alert actions.&nbsp; In
essence, RedAlert is like a Tag Management solution for alerts, giving
your
alert actions easy access to fields, search results, and alert
arguments.&nbsp; Searches come to life and become actionable as their
alerts issue shell commands and REST searches in response to events
in the infrastructure.&nbsp; Alert Actions become auditable, with
monitoring and logging of performance details, execution status, and
errors.&nbsp; Use RedAlert to automatically file
incidents with your CMDB, restart broken applications, lockdown ACLs in
response to threats, or page you, all at the click of a button...&nbsp;
or two...<br>
      <br>
Configuration is simple:<br>
      </big>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Install RedAlert on a Search Head.<br>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/alerts/bin/redalert.sh to
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts/redalert.sh -- use redalert.bat for Windows.<br>
</p></li>
        <li>[Optional]&nbsp; Configure _passwd_.conf with Splunk
credentials for REST API access.&nbsp; This is only necessary to
support alert actions that run searches; shell commands don&#8217;t need this.<br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Define your alert actions in RedAlert's &#8220;Configuration&#8221;
dashboard.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Save or Edit an alert in Splunk.&nbsp; To associate your
alert with a RedAlert action, place the RedAlert action's ID in
brackets, somewhere in the name of your Search/Alert.&nbsp; For
instance, a RedAlert action
whose ID is &#8220;SEARCH_SAMPLE&#8221; would match any search/alert that has
"[SEARCH_SAMPLE]&#8221; in its name.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Select to "Run a Script" as an action for your
alert.&nbsp; Type "redalert.sh" as the filename to run.&nbsp; (See
Diagram 1) -- use redalert.bat for Windows.<br>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Go to the &#8220;Overview&#8221; dashboard and monitor your alerts.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><big>* Use the `RedAlert` macro to search your audit logs for
alert execution details.</big></p>
NOTE:&nbsp;
RedAlert will configure a Data Input (<span style="font-weight: bold;">UDP:9020</span>) that listens only for "localhost" traffic.&nbsp; This is used to capture and index performance and
execution details for alerts.&nbsp; If this data needs to be indexed at
another location, be sure to configure the server to forward this data.<br>

</span></big><big>Troubleshooting:</big>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
After configuring your alerts, check the Overview dashboard inside the
app for status messages.&nbsp; The "Interesting Events" will show you
alert errors, as well as errors captured in _internal:web_services.log
and _internal:splunkd.log.<br>
