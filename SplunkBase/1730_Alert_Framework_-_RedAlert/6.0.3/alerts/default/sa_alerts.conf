command = kill -TERM $PID
description = This sample shell command illustrates what it might look like to fire an alert that kills a process when its CPU utilization is exceptionally high.  This example assumes the process ID field is named PID.  This will run for a scheduled search whose name contains [SHELL_SAMPLE].  Since :Max Iterations: = 1, this will only run for the latest event, each time the search is executed.

[SAMPLE_SEARCH]

entitytype = Search
command = |snow instance=CMDB request=incident action=insert short_description="$host had $count errors ($error) in the last hour." assignment_group="Service Desk" urgency=1
description = This sample search command illustrates using the ServiceNow app to file trouble tickets for hosts generating errors.  If the base search triggering the alert produces a list of hosts with errors (i.e. "sourcetype=syslog earliest=-1h@h | stats count values(error) AS error BY host"), this abbreviated search command will file a separate ticket for each host that had errors in the last hour.  This will run for a search whose name contains [SEARCH_SAMPLE], and it files a separate ticket for each of up to 3 events (:Max Iterations:) each time the search is executed.
