# Splunk MQTT Modular Input

1.7.7
-----
* added Websockets support

* The app performs periodic socket pings to the splunkd management port to determine if splunkd is still alive and if splunkd is not responding , usually because it has exited or is not network reachable, then the app self exits it's running java process.The default timeout is now 300 seconds. You can change this timeout value in bin/mqtt.py by setting the `SPLUNKD_TIMEOUT_SECS` variable. 

1.7.6
-----
* this version was skipped due to some Splunkbase upload issues.

1.7.5
-----
* in order to support huge modular input configuration xml strings when users want to run a very large number of inputs on 1 single instance of the MQTT Modular Input , we had to change the way that mqtt.py invokes it's child java process. Previously the xml string was passed as a program argument which could break the max argument size in the Linux kernel. Now we changed the logic to pass the xml string to the java process via the STDIN pipe.
