Import WSDL
The WSDL files are not included with this library due to licenses terms. pyaxl provides a script to import it and then build a cache directly into the library.

First of all you need to download the WSDL files. The AXL WSDL is included in the AXL SQL Toolkit download, which is available in Cisco Unified CM. Follow these steps to download the AXL SQL Toolkit from your Cisco Unified CM server:

Log into the Cisco Unified CM Administration application.
Go to Application | Plugins
Click on the Download link by the Cisco CallManager AXL SQL Toolkit Plugin.
The axlsqltoolkit.zip file contains the complete schema definition for different versions of Cisco Unified CM.

The important files for each version are:
AXLAPI.wsdl
AXLEnums.xsd
axlmessage.xsd
axlsoap.xsd
axl.xsd
