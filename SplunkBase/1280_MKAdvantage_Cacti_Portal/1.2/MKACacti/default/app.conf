description = The MKAdvantage Cacti Portal provides provides examples of pre-built data inputs, searches, reports, and dashboards for consolidating Cacti data from one or more Cacti servers.  The solution provides cross platform data sharing (perform a group calculation on multiple nodes on multiple servers and graph this), centralized administration of multiple Cacti servers, data context and service level reporting (tag several nodes on several machines so they can be reported on as a function, a location, a service, etc)and data relation in the environment (when my Cacti CPU graph goes up, what else is happening on other systems?)
