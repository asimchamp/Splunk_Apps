<h1>About Workflow kv Store App</h1>

<p>This application will give you a general idea about the way to use kv store with Splunk.</p>
<p>In order to explain how to work the workflow kv store app, i invit you to visit this link and read the tuto</p>

<p>In this tutorial, they recommand to convert the dashboards to HTML but it's really necessary you can use XML dashboards</p>

<p>So the workflow kv store contain only 3 dahsboards : </p>
<ul>
<li>Starter</li>
<li>In progress</li>
<li>Validation</li>
</ul> 

<p>The first one is "Starter" dashboard, it used to get or add new elements within data source</p>
<p>I added an event click using JavaScript to select items and stored into another kv collection named editcollection.
this collection is used by dashboard In progress.</p> 

<p>the second one is "In progress" dashboard. He implement the content dashboard with "editcollection" lookup and 
now you can add some description or any other input type just don't forget that on transform.conf.
So now you can add action on selected items (send to validation dashboard, remove or cancel all selection). When you send to validation dashbord
you can see what are added on validate table.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody ask the question, what is the back table in this dashboard? "don't worry we will return after"</p>

<p>Finally the last dashboard is validation. Here you can confirm selected items or not. You can use permission on dashboard to allow 
for privileged persons like an Admin.</p>
<p>If the any item should go back to edition statement you can use the button "back to edition" and now you have something with back table on 
In progress dashboard.</p>

<p>You can perform your item's status with color code or label. In this App i added this on Starter dashboard.</p>
