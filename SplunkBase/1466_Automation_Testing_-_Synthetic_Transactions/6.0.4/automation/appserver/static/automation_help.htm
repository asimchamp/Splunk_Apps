      Splunk for Automation Testing | Synthetic Transactions provides a
      Modular Input that allows Splunk to simulate a user's web browser
      experience, including support for cookies, client-side
      certificates, and proxy servers.&nbsp; This Modular Input allows
      Splunk to login to web sites, click around, submit forms, and
      index performance metrics and content.&nbsp; Use automation to
      ensure your web-based applications are healthy, your customer
      experience is preserved, and your web pages haven't been modified
      without your consent.<br>

    <ul type="square">
      <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">define the web pages you would
          like to monitor in /automation/local/_pages_.conf, including
          the behavior associated with each page.&nbsp; (see <b>_pages_.conf</b>
          for details.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">define sessions in
          /automation/local/_sessions_.conf that represent the lists of
          pages and in what order they will be browsed by a Data
          Input.&nbsp; client-side certificates and proxy settings are
          defined separately for each session.&nbsp; each session will
          represent a separate Data Input. (see <b>_sessions_.conf</b>
          for details.)<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">create a Data Input to invoke
          your session, including the amount of time in seconds Splunk
          will wait between browsing attempts for the session.<br>
        </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">first time users can copy _pages_.conf and _sessions_.conf from /automation/default/ into /automation/local/, then define a Data Input for one of the sample sessions, like splunk_home.  Data should populate rather quickly as sourcetype=automation.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <font face="Arial" size="-1">You can test your page and session
      settings at the command prompt, prior to implementing them within
      Splunk; please see _pages_.conf and _sessions_.conf for details.<br>
      <br>
      <u>NOTE</u>:&nbsp; If you need to reload changes you made to
      _pages_.conf or _sessions_.conf, you can <u>Disable</u> then <u>Enable</u>
      your Data Input to reload and restart the session.<br>
