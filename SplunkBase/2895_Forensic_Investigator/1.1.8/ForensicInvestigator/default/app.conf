description = TekDefense Forensic Investigator is is designed to be a Splunk toolkit for the first responder. Most tools do not need Internet access with the exception of a handful which use API calls to web services (for example:  Virus Total, Metascan, and whois).  The large amount of local processing makes the app perfect for even closed networks.
