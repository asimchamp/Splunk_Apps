				  This application is intended to be a complementary application to the offical Extrahop Splunk application. It is intended to provide a means to collect <b>specific metrics</b> for <b>specific nodes</b> in <a href="http://www.extrahop.com" target="_blank">Extrahop</a> by use of the Extrahop API. Metrics are collected on 5 minute intervals and are the raw metrics prior to any rollup/averaging.</td>

							  <li><b>pyamf</b> - can be found on the internet</li>
							  <li><b>pyhop</b> - can be found in this application's main directory</li>
							  <li><b>dateutils</b> - can be found on the internet</li>
							  <li><b>sideview-utils</b> - can be installed via the Splunk apps manager</li>

				  <b>Distributed Deployment Server Conerns</b><br>
				  Please not that this application should/need to live on the deployment server so that the lookup tables won't get over written. Management of which metrics should be collected should be done from this server as well.<br>
