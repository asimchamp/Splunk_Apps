        <h2>Windows Event Log Filtering</h2>
        <p>Provide capability for customers to filter event log channels based on standard fields in the event payload like Event Code, Task Category, Level , etc. This allows customers to target specific event entries that are of highest value to them while filtering out lower value events; thereby taking full advantage of their indexing volume.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Below is a sample stanza showing configuration in inputs.conf with two whitelist regexes highlighted -</p>
        <pre><code>[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled=0
whitelist1= EventCode=/^[4|5].*$/ Type=/Error|Warning/
whitelist2= TaskCategory=%^Log.*$%</code></pre>
        <br/>
        <p>The above configuration will result in the ingestion of Windows security event logs that match the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Events with EventCode that starts with the numbers 4 or 5 AND have type set to Error or Warning</li>
          <li>Events with TaskCategory that begin with “Log”.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Additional notes: Upto to 10 whitelist and 10 blacklist configuration can be specified for a given stanza. Blacklist override whitelist when conflicts occur. The regex terms for multiple criteria within a given whitelist/blacklist are treated as logical AND. The set of whitelists / blacklists are then logically OR to come up with the effective set that will apply to the stanza.</p>
