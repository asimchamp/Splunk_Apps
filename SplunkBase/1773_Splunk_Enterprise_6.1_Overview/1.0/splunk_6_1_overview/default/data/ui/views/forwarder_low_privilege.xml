        <h2>Low Privilege Windows Universal Forwarder</h2>
        <p>Customers in security sensitive environments can now run the Splunk Universal forwarder on Windows platforms as a domain user without having to grant that domain user local administrator privileges on the box. When configured to run in this low privilege mode, the Universal forwarder will continue to be able to run all the Windows inputs native to Splunk for data ingest in a secure manner.</p>
