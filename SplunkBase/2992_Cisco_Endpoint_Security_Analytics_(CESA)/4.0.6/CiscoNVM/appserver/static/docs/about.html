<p>The Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility App for Splunk allows an IT administrator to analyze and correlate user and endpoint behavior in Splunk Enterprise.

<br />This application provides collection and reporting of enhanced IPFIX flows generated by the Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility Module (NVM) both on and off premise.

<br />The AnyConnect module enriches endpoint flow records with additional context such as user, device, application, location and destination information.

</p>

<p>The Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility Module is based on the Cisco Network Visibility Flow protocol (<a href="http:////blogs.cisco.com/security/an-introduction-to-the-new-cisco-network-visibility-flow-protocol-nvzFlow">nvzFlow</a> for short), which leverages standards-based IPFIX vendor extensions.

<br />There are five key attribute collection parameters provided by The Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility Module:

<ul>

  <li>Devices</li>

  <li>Users</li>

  <li>Applications</li>

  <li>Locations</li>

  <li>Destinations</li>

</ul>

<p>The solution allows you to collect valuable telemetry data from endpoints running the Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility Module (NVM) and to apply analytics and reporting

<br />from the rich context provided by the flows.

</p>

<p>Cisco AnyConnect Network Visibility Module (NVM) App for Splunk is comprised of three components:

    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2992/">Splunk App</a> with pre-designed Dashboards to visualize and view the data.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221/">Splunk Add-on</a> which provides data indexing and formatting inside Splunk Enterprise.</li>
        <li>The NVM Collector Component which is responsible for collecting and translating all IPFIX (<a href="http:////blogs.cisco.com/security/an-introduction-to-the-new-cisco-network-visibility-flow-protocol-nvzFlow">nvzFlow</a>) data from the endpoints and forwarding it to the Splunk Add-on.</br>This is a manually installed component that runs on 64-bit Linux.</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>The Cisco Network Visibility Flow (nvzFlow) collector / translator can be installed on a standalone 64-bit Linux system, or on the same system that Splunk is running on,

<br />depending on system resources available.  Refer to the installation guide for more details.

</p>

<p>The sample set of Splunk reports are designed to assist enterprise IT administrators to explore the capabilities of the solution.  These reports offer varying degrees

<br />of summary information as well as drill down links to fine grain details.  Reports that support drill down links will have instructional text on how to introspect further.
