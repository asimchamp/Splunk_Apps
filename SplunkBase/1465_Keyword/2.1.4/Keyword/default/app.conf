description = This app presents a form where a user can type a keyword such as error and find top/timecharts of the results by source, sourcetype, and host on a dashboard. The same search could be used for finding last week vs. this week comparisons, to see if there are any sources, sourcetypes, or hosts that go above standard deviation plus the average count of occurrences, and to view a donut chart of distribution of different keywords by metadata.
