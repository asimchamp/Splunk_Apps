World City Info

Version: 0.9
System Requirement: Splunk 6.0 and newer

Usage:
This addon provides a custom command `cityinfo', if your data has a column of city names,
you can use it to get the longitude and latitude of that city,
e.g., index=business_all_nation | cityinfo city. If the data has country and regional codes,
like 'us', 'NY', you can use them to refine the match of city names,
e.g., index=business_all_nation | eval country="us" | cityinfo city country=country.
If a match of city name is found, two extra fields: `lat' and `lon',  will be added to each row.
