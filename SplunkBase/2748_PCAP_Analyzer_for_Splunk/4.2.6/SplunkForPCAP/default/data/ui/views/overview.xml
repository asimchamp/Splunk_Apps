						<h3>Getting started - Requirements!</h3>
						<b>Step 1: Make sure the ../SplunkForPCAP/bin/ folder has all administrative privileges to execute the batch and shell script</b><br />
						<b>Step 2: Make sure you have tshark installed (delivered with Wireshark)</b><br />
						<b>Step 3: Make sure you have set SPLUNK_HOME variable</b><br />
                        <br /><br />
                        <b>Click on the next slide and check how to configure the PCAP File Location!</b>
                        <br /><br />

						<h3>Getting started - PCAP File Location!</h3>
						To allow Splunk to collect your PCAP Files you have to specify where you have stored your pcap files.<br />
						You can specify your location in the Data Inputs (via Settings) --> PCAP File Location.<br />

                        <b>Click on the next slide to understand what happens with your pcap files after they are indexed!</b>
                        <br /><br />

						<h3>Getting started - Notes about the data!</h3>
						1. Sourcetype defined for indexing that data is "pcap:csv"<br />
						2. You will recognize that after you can see your pcap file indexed in Splunk it is removed from your source folder. The new location of the PCAP File is: $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\SplunkForPCAP\PCAPConverted. That is happening to avoid that the automatic script converts your pcap file twice.<br />
                        <br /><br />
