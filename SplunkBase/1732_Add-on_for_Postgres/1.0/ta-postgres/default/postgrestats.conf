#
# This is the default configuration file for the database connection script (postgrestats.py)
# To use this, create a copy within the 'local' directory
#
# Create the default stanza entry for Postgres server that you want to monitor:
# 
# [default]
# defaultdb = postgres
# host = localhost
# port = 5432
# user = splunkreader
# password = {md5}p@ssw0rd
#
#
# You can monitor more than one Postgres server.
# For each server you should create stanza similar to default.
# Just change the stanza name and set relevant parameters:
#
# [host1]
# defaultdb = postgres1
# host = host1.test.com
# port = 5432
# user = splunk
# password = {md5}p@ssw0rd
#
# Then in inputs.conf create the following type of stanzas:
#
# [script://./bin/postgrestats <view_name> host1]
# ....
#
#   
#
# The defaultdb entry is a name of a database to connect to.
# This database should contain performance data. It's postgres by default.
#
# The host entry is the Postgres server  hostname or IP address  
# 
# The port entry is a number of TCP connection port on which the Postgres server is listening
#
# The user entry is a login to Postgres server
#
# The password entry is the login password. It should be in form '{md5}...'
