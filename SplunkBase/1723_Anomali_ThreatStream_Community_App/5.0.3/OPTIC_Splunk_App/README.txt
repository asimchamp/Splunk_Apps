== Anomali ThreatStream Community Splunk App ==

The Anomali ThreatStream Community Splunk App is available for download on Splunkbase (http://splunkbase.splunk.com) and is packaged as a standard Splunk application.  The primary goal of the application is to add threat intelligence context to existing customer event data based on common industry accepted Indicators of Compromise (IOC) keys such as file hash, domain, src/dest ip address, e-mail address, etc.  The app allows customers to identify  potential threats and breaches in their event data in Splunk and triage the matched events to take remedial actions.

It is important to note that the App as downloaded from Spunk Apps is pre-populated with a small sampling of the overall ThreatStream Intelligence database.  This sampling of intelligence content keeps the app distribution size manageable and provides a means for someone to fully explore the app without any sort of "introduction" to ThreatStream. 


== System Requirements ==
The Anomali ThreatStream Community Splunk App is supported with Splunk versions 6.4.x running on a Linux (64-bit) or Windows (64-bit or 32-bit) platform. 

==  Documentation ==
See app description on Splunkbase.
