* Configure the RS232 to Ethernet Converter (CSE-H53N - Industrial RS232 to Ethernet Converter) for send Omnipcx call detail over TCP port 6970.
* Install the Splunk package

Limitations
-----------

Phone settings for local and international call prefixes, call charges, special numbers, and emergency call numbers are specific to each country. Thatâ€™s why the application is set up for two countries: the USA and France.      

The application is set up by default with these parameters:

* International call screening is based on the outgoing prefix 00 
* Screening special numbers or emergency numbers is specific to France. Costs indications for France will be available on January 1st 2015. To change phone numbers for the USA, modifications must be brought to the file OXO_Special_Call_Number_US.csv
