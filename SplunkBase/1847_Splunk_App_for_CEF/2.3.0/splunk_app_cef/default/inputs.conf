## We create one batch input stanza per _TCP_ROUTING group
## The stanza corresponds to the file param we hand to "| cefout"
## For instance "... | cefout routing=<routing group>"

## Catchall in case your input is missing we will default to cefroute
## We are going to be employing checks in "| cefout" to ensure that
## you don't attempt to route data to a non-existent output group
## This stanza will remain for backwards compatibility and rigidity
