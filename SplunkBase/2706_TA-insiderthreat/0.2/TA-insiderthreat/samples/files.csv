These units played special 16 2/3 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were gramophone-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of Popular Science along with a Jaguar and an MG.

The club's crest contains a stylised representation of the town's two most famous landmarks, Dover Castle and the white cliffs, enclosed in a circle bearing the club's name. The club then appointed former England international Peter Taylor as manager, but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto their place in the Conference only because Northern Premier League runners-up Boston United failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline. In the 2009-10 season, Dover reached the play-offs for promotion to the Conference National, but lost at the semi-final stage to Woking. In Dover's first season back in the Southern League Premier Division the Whites finished in third place, albeit 17 points adrift of Tamworth, who claimed the one promotion place available that season."
