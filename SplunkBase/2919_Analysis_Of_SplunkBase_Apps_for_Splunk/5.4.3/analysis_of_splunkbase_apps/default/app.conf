description = After being asked for a list of Splunk Apps in a spreadsheet a few times, I found a need to build this App.  This App provides a simple dashboard with App stats and allows you to search for Splunk Apps within Splunk. It was also designed to work if you are offline, as long as you have been online once to collect data.

version = 5.4.3
