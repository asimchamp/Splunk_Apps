# This entry below assumes phone numbers have the format 123-456-7890
# and are prefaced by the term "phone_no=".  The extraction finds the first
# 6 digits (123-456) and creates the field "areacode".  Please adjust the REGEX
# field to fit your data.  This extraction is required for the mapping to work.
