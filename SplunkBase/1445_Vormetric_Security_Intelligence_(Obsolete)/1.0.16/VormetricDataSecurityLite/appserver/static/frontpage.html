	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<ul>
	  <p>
		The <b>Vormetric Security Intelligence</b>
		application for Splunk&reg; provides a number of security intelligence reports 
		and enables search operations that can be used to extract information from the 
		log streams produced by Vormetric encryption agents and the Vormetric Data 
		Security Manager (DSM).
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Important Note:
		<ul>
		  <p>
			Much of the required information is extracted from audit log messages 
			generated by Vormetric agents when user programs access files protected by 
			a <i>Guard Point</i>, which is a directory protected by the Vormetric 
			Filesystem agent. This requires that the Guard Point has been 
			set up using a <i>policy</i> where the rules include an <i>audit</i> 
			effect, and that the agent has been configured to send <i>INFO</i> level 
			log messages to the Splunk system, either directly from the agent, or 
			forwarded by the DSM.
		  </p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li> If info-level audit logging of Guard Point accesses is not provided,
			     the Splunk reports might not provide useful results.
			</li>
		  	<li> The log streams provided to Splunk must in RFC5424 Syslog format, 
			     else field extraction will not work correctly. This is selected in
				 the DSM when defining the syslog stream formats.
			</li>
			<li> The reports and searches might not provide useful information
			     until a sufficient volume of log events has been captured by
			     Splunk.
			</li> 
			<li> This app by default assumes log data will be received by Splunk 
			     via TCP and/or UDP on port 5514.
			</li> 
		  </ul>
		</ul>
		</p>
	  <h2>Use of "Drill Down" in reports</h2>
	  <p>
		Splunk supports a feature known as "drill down". This allows you to 
		examine any particular report entry at a deeper level, by giving 
		access to the underlying log records that were used to create a report.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		To use drill down, simply click on any line within a table, or double-click
		on an element in a chart or graphical report.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Alternatively, use the "View results" link below a report to see 
		all the log data that was selected to create the report.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Use of VSI Data Model and Pivot</h2>
	  <p>
		A Splunk data model is included in this app, named "Vormetric Security Intelligence Logs",
		or "VSI", that can be used in conjunction with Splunk's Pivot to rapidly
		create reports and dashboards from Vormetric log streams.
	  </p>

	<h3>Note: Naming Data Sources</h3>
	<p>
	The two charts above that classify accesses against a "Data Source"
	use a lookup table to map from the host name and guard point path 
	to the name of a company division. By default, this lookup will return 
	the name "Others" for all guard points.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can update the mapping so that the entries reflect the names of
	data sources within your own company using the following procedure:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		Create a file, named "divisions.csv" with the following content:
		<p></p>
		<ol>
		  <li>
			A header line, containing "host,gp,Division"
		  </li>
		  <li>
			One line for each named company division, where each line
			contains three entries, namely a host name, a guard point path,
			and the name of the division.  For example 
			<pre>
			  host,gp,Division
			  host1.company.com,/usr/fs/hr,Human Resources
			  host2.*,/usr/dev/*,Development Files
			</pre>
			Note that the first two fields may contain * for wildcard matching.
		  </li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li>
		Upload this file to the Splunk server as follows:
		<p></p>
		<ol>
		  <li>
			Select "Lookups" -&gt; "Lookup table files" under the 
			"Manager" or "Settings" menu, depending on which version of Splunk
			you are using.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Select "Vormetric Security Intelligence"
			from the App context
		  </li>
		  <li>
			If there is an existing file named "divisions.csv" in a directory
			under ".../users/admin/..." then delete it using the "Delete" action.
			<br>
			Note: A file of this name under ".../etc/apps/..." does not need
			to be deleted.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Select "New", then use the "browse" button to locate the file
			you have created.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Enter "divisions.csv" in the "Destination filename" box.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Select "Save"
		  </li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Searches</h1>
	<ul>
	  <table cellpadding=4 border=4px width=95% >
		<tr style="vertical-align:top;">
		  <td width=30%>
			<h2>Message Types by Severity</h2>
			<p>
			  This search allows the user to get counts of all log messages received in
			  the selected period, classified by origin, severity, and message type.
			</p>
			<p>
			  For example, you use this to see if some agent has been reporting high
			  numbers of error messages.
			</p>
		  </td>
		  <td width=30%>
			<h2>File Accesses</h2>
			<p>
			  This multi-part report shows total number of audited accesses to Guard Points
			  for each agent. By selecting a line in the report, you can see
			  what types of accesses have been made and to what files. By selecting an
			  individual file, you can see which users attempted the accesses, classified
			  by the type and access, and if they were succesful.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Finally, by selecting an individual user/file/access type combination,
			  you can see details of when it occured, what process was running, and
			  what policy was being applied. As usual, a final drill down will show
			  you the source log data for each entry.
			</p>
		  </td>
		  <td width=30%>
			<h2>User Accesses</h2>
			<p>
			  This multi-part report shows total number of audited accesses to Guard Points
			  for each known user, listed against each Agent host name, and
			  sorted by number of accesses. By selecting a line in the report, you can 
			  see what types of accesses have been made and to what files, listed against
			  specific Guard Points. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Finally, by selecting an individual user/file/access type combination,
			  you can see details of when it occured, what process was running, and
			  what policy was being applied. As usual, a final drill down will show
			  you the source log data for each entry.

	<h1>Reference</h1>
	<ul>
	  <h2>Vormetric Data Security Message Catalog</h2>
		<p>
		  This reference section allows you to look into the full message catalog
		  for VDS log messages, from agents and the DSM.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Use this to get details of a known log message, using the unique log
		  message ID value as the key. Alternatively, you can use the navigation
		  buttons to browse the catalog.
		</p>
		<p>
		  For users who wish to create their own reports, this provides a reference
		  for all the additional fields to be found in each log message, and explains 
		  how the fields are used for each message type.
