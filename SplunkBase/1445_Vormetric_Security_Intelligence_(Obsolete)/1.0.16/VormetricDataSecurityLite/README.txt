Vormetric Security Intelligence
-------------------------------

Description

    The Vormetric Security Intelligence application for 
	Splunk (R) provides a number of security intelligence reports and enables 
	search operations that can be used to extract information from the log 
	streams produced by Vormetric encryption agents and the Vormetric Data 
	Security Manager (DSM).

    See http://www.vormetric.com/products/encryption/index.html

    Much of the required information is extracted from audit log messages 
    generated by Vormetric agents when user programs access files protected by 
    a Guard Point, which is a directory protected by the Vormetric Filesystem 
    agent. This requires that the Guard Point has been set up using 
    a "policy" where the rules include an "audit" effect, and that the agent 
    has been configured to send "INFO" level log messages to the Splunk 
    system, either directly from the agent, or forwarded by the DSM.

    * If info-level audit logging of Guard Point accesses is not provided,
      the Splunk reports might not provide useful results.

    * The log streams provided to Splunk must in RFC5424 Syslog format, 
      else field extraction will not work correctly. This is selected in
      the DSM when defining the syslog stream formats.

    * The reports and searches might not provide useful information
      until a sufficient volume of log events has been captured by Splunk.

    * This app by default assumes log data will be received by Splunk 
      via TCP and/or UDP on port 5514.
