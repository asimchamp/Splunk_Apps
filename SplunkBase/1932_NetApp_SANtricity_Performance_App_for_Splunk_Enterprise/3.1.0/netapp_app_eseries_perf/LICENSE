END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This end user license agreement ("Agreement") is a contractual agreement between you ("You" or "Your") and NetApp ("NetApp"), and provides the terms under which NetApp licenses its i) software, including where relevant, backup and recovery, disaster recovery, storage efficiency and management software, operating systems, protocols, updates and upgrades ("Software"), and ii) technical documentation describing the Software ("Documentation") to You, whether supplied by NetApp, Your NetApp distributor, reseller or partner.  Any support is provided under a separate agreement.

1. Acceptance. By downloading, installing, copying, accessing or using the Software and Documentation, or by clicking the "I ACCEPT" button below, You agree that this Agreement will exclusively govern NetApp's license and Your use of the Software and Documentation unless You have a separate applicable written agreement with NetApp which governs NetApp's license and Your use of the Software and Documentation.

If You are accepting this Agreement on behalf of another person, company or other legal entity (whether as an employee, contractor, distributor, reseller, partner, agent or otherwise), You represent and warrant that You have full authority to bind them.  If You do not agree to the above, do not download, install, copy, access, or use the Software and Documentation, or click the "I ACCEPT" button, and promptly return the Software and Documentation to the party from whom it was obtained.

2. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NetApp grants to You a personal, non-exclusive, worldwide, limited and terminable license, without the right to sublicense, to i) install and use the Software (in object code form) for Your internal business purposes, and ii) use the Documentation in support of Your use of the Software.  The Software may either be licensed for use with i) a specific storage controller identified by a unique serial number ("Controller-based licenses"), or ii) independent of a storage controller ("Standalone licenses").  Software is licensed in accordance with one of the following license types:  
a) "Life-of-controller licenses": Controller-based licenses granted for the period of time during which Your controller is operable; 
b) "Perpetual licenses":  Standalone licenses granted in perpetuity; 
c) "Term licenses":  Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a fixed period of time;
d) "Capacity licenses":  Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a specified amount of storage capacity or usage; and 
e) "Subscription licenses":  Term licenses or Capacity licenses which may be purchased on a periodic basis.  

Certain license types may require the installation and use of AutoSupportTM.

Each storage controller deployed in a cluster or a high-availability pair or group must have the same Controller-based licenses as the other storage controllers in that cluster, high-availability pair or group.  Subject to NetApp's prior written agreement, and in the context of non-disruptive operations within a cluster, You may deploy storage controllers with different Controller-based licenses and failover from one storage controller to another for the time required to remedy a failure, provided that all storage controllers in the cluster have the same hardware and software support offerings in effect at all times.  

Use of the Software outside of the scope of this Agreement constitutes a material breach and You agree to promptly pay to NetApp any additional license fees notified by NetApp, calculated in accordance with NetApp's price list.

3. License Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly licensed to You, You shall not, nor shall You allow any third party to: 
a) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or otherwise reduce it to human-readable form except to the extent required for interoperability purposes under applicable laws or as expressly permitted in open-source licenses; 
b) remove or conceal any product identification, copyright, proprietary, patent or other notices in the Software and Documentation; 
c) assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, the Software and Documentation licenses to another party or Controller-based licenses to a different storage controller; 
d) use the Software and Documentation to perform services for third parties in a service bureau, managed services, commercial hosting services or similar environment; 
e) modify, adapt or create a derivative work of the Software and Documentation; and 
f) publish or provide any Software benchmark or comparison test results.

4. Intellectual Property Rights And Protection. The Software and Documentation is licensed, not sold, to You.  It is protected by intellectual property laws and treaties worldwide, and contains trade secrets, in which NetApp and its licensors reserve and retain all rights not expressly granted to You.  No right, title or interest to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name, of NetApp or its licensors is granted to You.  

NetApp will defend You against claims brought by a third party alleging that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright ("IP Claim") and indemnify You for a settlement amount or the judgment amount finally awarded for such IP Claim (collectively, "Damages") provided that You have: 
a) promptly notified NetApp in writing of the IP Claim; 
b) provided information and assistance to NetApp; and 
c) given NetApp sole control of the defense and settlement negotiations.    

NetApp has no liability for claims that arise from: 
a) unauthorized modification or use of the Software by You or a third party; 
b) combination, operation, or use of the Software with any products not provided by NetApp; 
c) services offered by You or revenues earned by You for such services; 
d) NetApp's compliance with or use of Your designs, specifications, instructions or technical information provided by You or a third party on Your behalf; or 
e) Your failure to install an upgrade, new version, change or modification made available or requested by NetApp.  

NetApp may, at its discretion: 
a) substitute the Software with a functional equivalent in all material respects; 
b) modify the Software so long as it remains a functional equivalent in all material respects; 
c) obtain for You, at NetApp's expense, the right to continue use of the Software; or 
d) take back such Software and refund to You the purchase price paid for it, less depreciation amortized on a straight line basis over a three (3) year period from date of first delivery of the Software to You.  

NetApp's cumulative aggregate liability arising under this section 4 will not exceed USD$500,000.  To the extent permitted by applicable laws, this section 4 sets out Your exclusive remedies for any IP Claim.  

5. Direct Warranty. NetApp warrants to You that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of first delivery of the Software to You, Your NetApp distributor, reseller or partner, whichever is the earlier, or such other minimum periods under applicable laws, (the "Software Warranty Period"), for the initially-shipped version of such Software, that i) the Software will materially conform to the then-current Documentation in effect on the date of Software delivery, and ii) the media containing the Software will be free from physical defects.  NetApp does not warrant that Your use of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.  In the event of any material defect in the Software during the Software Warranty Period, NetApp will, at its sole discretion and expense, repair or replace the Software, or refund the purchase price paid by You for the non-conforming Software. This warranty covers only material defects in the Software that are reproducible and verifiable and does not cover software, other items, or any services provided by persons other than NetApp or a NetApp distributor, reseller or partner.  The Software warranty will be void if You or any third parties misuse, neglect, improperly install or test, attempt to repair or modify (except as authorized by NetApp in writing), or use the Software beyond the range of the intended use.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND NO OTHER WARRANTY OR REMEDY, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. NETAPP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCEPTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

6. Limitation of Liability. Except for claims arising under section 4 above, and regardless of the basis of the claim (e.g. contract, tort or statute), the total liability of NetApp and its licensors, under or in connection with this Agreement, shall not exceed the amount actually received by NetApp for the Software or the minimum amounts permitted by applicable laws.  NetApp and its licensors are not liable for:
a) any indirect, incidental, exemplary, special or consequential damages; 
b) loss or corruption of data; 
c) loss of revenues, profits, goodwill or anticipated savings; 
d) procurement of substitute goods and/or services; or 
e) interruption to business; even if it has been advised of the possibility of such claims or damages.  

The limitations and exclusions above shall not apply to liability for death or bodily injury caused by negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable laws.

7. Audit. You grant NetApp and its independent accountants the right to examine Your Software usage once annually during regular business hours upon reasonable notice to verify compliance with this Agreement.  If the audit discloses material non-compliance, You shall promptly pay to NetApp any additional license fees notified by NetApp, calculated in accordance with NetApp's price list, and the reasonable costs of conducting such audit, if any.  Following any non-compliance, you may be subjected to more frequent audits. 

8. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You may terminate the Agreement at any time on written notice to NetApp.  NetApp may terminate this Agreement immediately on written notice to You if You commit a material breach of the Agreement, including remitting payments when due (whether payable to NetApp or its authorized third party financing partners in connection with an Approved Financing Agreement, described in section 13 below) and, in the event that the breach is remediable, fail to remedy it within thirty (30) days of NetApp's written notice requiring You to do so.  Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights to use the Software and Documentation cease and You shall, at NetApp's request, promptly return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation, including any license enablement keys, in Your possession or under Your control.  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

9. Software Copyright Information And Notices. Software copyright information and other related details are included as part of notices in the Documentation or other documentation published by NetApp (e.g. NOTICES.TXT or NOTICES. PDF).

10. U.S. Government Regulations. Software and Documentation license rights granted to governments and other public sector entities include only those rights customarily provided to commercial end-user customers.  In particular, NetApp provides the licenses for Software and Documentation in this Agreement to the U.S. federal government pursuant to FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and for the Department of Defense pursuant to DFARS 252.227-7015 (Technical Data - Commercial Items) and DFARS 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  

Some Software components have been designed to enable compliance with 'non-rewriteable and non-erasable' US government regulations.  When enabled, they i) will preserve data in a non-rewriteable and non-erasable format, ii) may disable other Software restoration functionality, and iii) could limit support and recovery procedures, if relevant.  You will ensure that Your internal processes and systems, including but not limited to the use of the Software, comply with all applicable "non-rewriteable and non-erasable" US government regulations.  NetApp fully disclaims any associated liability.

11. Export Control Laws And Regulations. The Software and Documentation is subject to applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries and You agree to comply with them. You represent and warrant that You: 
a) will not, directly or indirectly, export or re-export the Software and Documentation to, or use the Software and Documentation in, countries subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions programs, unless authorized by U.S. export licenses or other government authorizations (as of December 2012, these countries are: Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria); 
b) will comply with any updates and revisions that the U.S. Government makes to the sanctions, embargoes and the list of countries specified in section 11(a) above; 
c) are not a party, nor will you export or re-export to a party, identified on any government export exclusion lists, including but not limited to the U.S. Denied Persons, Entity, and Specially Designated Nationals Lists; and 
d) will not use the Software and Documentation for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including but without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missile, chemical, biological weaponry or other weapons of mass destruction.

12. Data Privacy. You have sole responsibility for personal data managed or stored using the Software and agree to comply with all applicable data privacy laws.

13. Financed Software. This Agreement also applies to "Financed Software," which means Software and Documentation licensed to You for a limited period of use pursuant to the terms of a financing agreement between You and NetApp or its authorized third party financing partner (an "Approved Financing Agreement"), subject to the following: 
a) The particular Financed Software, period of use, installation site and other transaction-specific conditions shall be as agreed in the applicable Approved Financing Agreement; and 
b) Notwithstanding any contrary terms in this Agreement, all licenses for Financed Software terminate at the expiration of the term of the Approved Financing Agreement or when sooner terminated by NetApp (whether in accordance with this Agreement or the Approved Financing Agreement).  

You agree that the license granted under section 2 above and NetApp's termination rights under section 8 above may be affected by an authorized third party financing partner's rights under the applicable Approved Financing Agreement, even if such partner has paid to NetApp all or any portion of the license fees for the Financed Software.

14. Evaluation Software. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as amended by this section 14, NetApp may grant to You evaluation licenses for the Software and Documentation at no cost for a ninety (90) days period from the initial delivery of the Software to You, Your NetApp distributor, reseller or partner, whichever is the earlier, or such other period as agreed by NetApp in writing.  Such licenses may only be used in a non-production environment to assess the suitability of the Software and Documentation for Your needs.  Notwithstanding section 5 above, the evaluation Software and Documentation is licensed to You on an "AS IS" basis and all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise are excluded to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws. 

15. General. This Agreement shall be construed pursuant to the laws of i) the State of California, United States, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, if You are located in the United States or in a country in which NetApp has no local sales subsidiary, or ii) the country in which You are located if NetApp has a local sales subsidiary in that country.  NetApp reserves the right to control all aspects of any lawsuit or claim that arises from Your use of the Software and Documentation.  If required by NetApp's agreement with a third party licensor, NetApp's licensor shall be a direct and intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce it directly against You.  NetApp does not waive any of its rights under this Agreement by failing to or delaying the exercise of its rights or partially exercising its rights at any time.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  This Agreement may not be changed except by an amendment accepted by an authorized representative of each party.  In the event of a dispute between the English and non-English version of the Agreement (where translated for local requirements), the English version of this Agreement shall govern, to the extent permitted by applicable laws.  This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding between NetApp and You with respect to the Software and Documentation.  It supersedes any previous communications, representations or agreements between NetApp and You and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or similar communication between the parties.
