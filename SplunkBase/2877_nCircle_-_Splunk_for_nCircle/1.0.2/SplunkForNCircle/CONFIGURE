Splunk For nCircle - CONFIGURE
-------------------------------------------------------------
09/21/2015


1. Referenced Architecture

(a) Splunk Searchhead -- over tcp/8089 --> (b) Splunk indexer <-- over tcp/8089 -- (c) Splunk HeavyForwarder -- over tcp/443 --> (d) IP360 nCircle APIv2

1.1. App Deployment
(a) - enable app itself
(b) - enable index for vulnerability data from nCircle
(c) - enable inputs in the App

1.2. Dependencies
- Tripwire IP360 Version 6.9 and higher to support APIv2
- Python interpreter on Heavy Forwarder to run the scripts enabled in inputs.conf (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Configuration

2.1. nCircle Setup
- configure user on nCircle IP360 appliance to get proper access rights to run APIv2 commands. 
- connection is initiated by Splunk towards nCircle IP360 over tcp/443. Credentials are configured in the ncircle.conf file

2.2. Data adjustment
- data is being fetched according to unique identificators in the IP360 system.
- run setup.py in bin folder to get proper variables for scripts below
- setup.py will output:
* valid ncircle.conf file
* min ID and max ID for getAuditLog.py. Choose reasonable ID and adjust variable called latest_counter in the script located in $APP_HOME$/bin folder
* min ID and max ID for getAuditDetails.py. Choose reasonable ID and adjust variable called blg in the script located in $APP_HOME$/bin folder
* list of device profilers to adjust variable deviceProfilers in getAuditDetails.py and getActiveScans.py

3. App Deployment

3.1. Searchhead
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- verify macros.conf file and ensure the proper splunk_server, index, sourcetype (see 3.3.) is used

3.2. Indexer
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- adjust and enable indexes.conf file

3.3. Heavy Forwarder
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- adjust and enable inputs.conf file
- be aware that fields in sourcetype=_json is being automatically extracted by Splunk. If changed, all fields should be extracted. The sourcetype should be adjusted in the 3.1. step


4. Troubleshooting
- run the scripts manually:
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditLog.py
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditDetails.py
- if it does not help, run python with debuger:
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python -m pdb /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditLog.py
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python -m pdb /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditDetails.py
