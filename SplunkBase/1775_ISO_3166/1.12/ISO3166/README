ISO 3166-1 Country Codes
------------------------
Offical information on the specification: http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes
Useful information on the specification: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166

ISO 3166-1 provides 3 different types of Country Codes:

alpha-2: Two letter country codes, the most common version. MAXMIND and Splunk itself (v6) use this.
alpha-3: Three letter country codes, designed to provide "better visual association" (per Wikipedia)
numeric: Three digit country codes, used by the UN, designed to be (mostly) language independent.

The list was retrieved from the ISO website in the 1st quarter of 2014 and manipulated with awk and sed
to create the CSV lookup table.

Column headers are "alpha-2,alpha-3,numeric"

After installation you will need to restart Splunk or force a reload of props.conf with "| extract reload=T"

Use:

| lookup iso3166 [existing field] AS [new field]

The list of Country Codes was obtained from https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes.git
and is current as of November 2017 (last UN update October 2013)
