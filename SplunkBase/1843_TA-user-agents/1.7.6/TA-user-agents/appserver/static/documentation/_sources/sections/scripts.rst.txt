This App provides the following scripts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 15
   :header-rows: 0

   * - Diag.py
     - For use with the `diag` command.
   * - fetch_latest.sh
     - For grabbing the most recent versions of the libraries.
   * - user_agents.py
     - This is the lookup command python to parse the user agent.

Note: ``fetch_latest.sample`` is a bash script that would need to be renamed and have +x added to it in order to be a valid script. This script updates the libraries for on-prem installations.
