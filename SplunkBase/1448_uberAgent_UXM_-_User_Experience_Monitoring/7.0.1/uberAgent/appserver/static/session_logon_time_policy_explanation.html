            <dd>The table contains additional columns, one for each client-side extension (CSE) that was active during a logon. Since the number of CSEs is high and third-party software vendors can create their own, uberAgent cannot display a finite list. It displays what it finds, instead. As a result the CSEs displayed will vary between environments.<br>
            Examples for CSEs:<br>
            <em>Registry</em> - Typical group policy settings stored in the registry<br>
            <em>Group Policy Environment</em> - Environment variables set by Group Policy Preferences</dd>
