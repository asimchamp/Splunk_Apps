# Splunk Twilio Modular Alert v1.4.0

## IMPORTANT

The Python code in this App is dual 2.7/3 compatible.
This version of the App enforces Python 3 for execution of the modular input script when running on Splunk 8+ in order to satisfy Splunkbase AppInspect requirements.
If running this App on Splunk versions prior to 8 , then Python 2.7 will get executed.

## App Object Permissions

Everyone's Splunk environment and Users/Roles/Permissions setup are different.

By default this App ships with all of it's objects globally shared (in `metadata/default.meta` )

So if you need to limit access to functionality within the App , such as who can see the setup page , then you should browse to  `Apps -> Manage Apps -> Twilio SMS Alerting -> View Objects` , and adjust the permissions accordingly for your specific Splunk environment.

## Logging

Modular Alert logs will get written to `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/twilioalert_app_modularalert.log`

Setup logs will get written to `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/twilioalert_app_setuphandler.log`

These logs are rotated daily with a backup limit of 5.

The Modular Alert logging level can be specified on the setup page. The default level is `INFO`.

You can search for these log sources in the `_internal` index or browse to the `Logs` menu item on the App's navigation bar.

Any Splunk internal errors can also be searched like : `index=_internal twilio.py ERROR`

## Troubleshooting

1) Is your "from number" correct and valid for sending SMS messages via Twilio ?
2) Are your alerts actually firing ?
3) Are your Auth token and Account SID correct ?
