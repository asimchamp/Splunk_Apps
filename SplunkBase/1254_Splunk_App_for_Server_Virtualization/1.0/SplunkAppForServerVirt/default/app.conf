description = The Splunk App for Server Virtualization visualizes performance and environment data for popular server virtualization platforms including Citrix XenServer and Microsoft Hyper-V. Several example dashboards are included that visualize the data in a series of operational dashboards covering IT Operations, Capacity Planning, and Performance Monitoring. IT and Security professionals can now use at-a-glance dashboards for their services, users and infrastructure. A Technology Addon (TA) is required to populate the necessary indexes.  These TAs can be downloaded from splunk.com.
