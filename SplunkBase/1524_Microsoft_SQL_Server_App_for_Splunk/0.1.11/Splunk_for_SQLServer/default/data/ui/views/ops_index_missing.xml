        <html>This table indicates potential optimizations by adding new indices to databases.
        The Index Impact is a value that indicates the effect of an index on the speed of queries on the table.
        A higher number is more impactful. Look for possible indices that are used often (as indicated by the
        sparkline) and have a high index impact.  As always, consult the application owner prior to making
        any changes to indices within a database.</html>
