<p>The Splunk App for SQL Server supports Windows Server 2008R2 and above and SQL Server 2008R2 and above.  
For full data coverage, you must install the following Add-ons:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/28933/splunk-for-windows-technology-add-on">Splunk Technology Add-on for Windows</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/82353/splunk-add-on-for-microsoft-powershell">Splunk Add-on for PowerShell</a></li>
	<li>Splunk Technology Add-on for SQL Server</li>
</ul>

<p>The Splunk Technology Add-on for SQL Server is distributed with the Splunk App for SQL Server and is
located in the <tt>Splunk_for_SQLServer/appserver/addons</tt> directory.</p>

<p>If you have followed the Splunk recommendation of enabling the deployment server, you may use the
deployment server to push out these apps.  They do not require any configuration.  An example
serverclass.conf file is provided with the app.  It just needs to have a machine whitelist added.</p>
