	<label>Install the Splunk Universal Forwarder on your SQL Server</label>
	<row>
		<html>
<p>The Splunk Universal Forwarder may be installed as either the local system user or as a domain
user.   Follow the appropriate instructions in the <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Deploy/Introducingtheuniversalforwarder">Splunk Documentation</a>
for information on this topic.</p>

<p>Once the Splunk Universal Forwarder has been installed, you must allow the user that is running
the Splunk Universal Forwarder access to the SQL Server.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start the SQL Server Management Studio</li>
	<li>Connect to the SQL Server being configured</li>
	<li>Log in as a user in the sysadmin role</li>
	<li>In the left-hand navigation, open Security -&gt; Logins</li>
	<li>Right-click on Logins and select New Login...</li>
	<li>In the Login Name box, enter the user that is running the Splunk Universal Forwarder</li>
	<li>Click on OK to add the user</li>
	<li>Double-click on the user you have just selected</li>
	<li>Select Server Roles</li>
	<li>Check the box next to "sysadmin"</li>
	<li>Click on OK to update the server roles</li>
</ol>

<p>If you installed the Splunk Universal Forwarder as the local system user, this is represented on
the SQL Server as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and already exists.  Ensure you perform the last 4 steps to
enable the user as a sysadmin user.</p>

<p>You may also want to restrict the permissions granted to the Splunk process.   This is outside the
scope of these instructions.  However, be aware that the splunk process needs system read access to all
databases.  It does not need to change any data.  The sysadmin role already has these permissions.</p>

<p>We recommend linking the Splunk Universal Forwarder to a Splunk Deployment Server so that you may
easily deploy the required add-ons from a central location.</p>
