        <html>This table indicates potential optimizations by removing indices that are not being
        user enough.  It displays indices where the number of writes to the index exceeds the number
        of reads.  Look for indices that are seldom used, but written to frequently.  As always,
        consult with the application owner prior to deleting an index.</html>
