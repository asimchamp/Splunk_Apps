              * Click on the Save button at the bottom of the page.

        * Fetch Sites button:
          * After providing MSO credentials from any of the above two modes, the user can click the Fetch Sites button.
          * It will display sites (i.e. APIC) associated with MSO, so users can directly provide site credentials here to configure in Splunk.
          * After providing credentials, click on the Save button at the bottom of the page.
          * By default SSL verification is enabled. If MSO or APIC Site is configured with Self Signed Certificate refer SSL Configuration section. 
          
          * Follow below steps to disable the SSL verification entirely before configuring credentials through setup page:
          * Copy the file "default/app_setup.conf" to "local/app_setup.conf"
          * Change the value of `verify_ssl` parameter to `False` under stanza [fetch_sites_ssl]
          * Restart Splunk
          * This will disable the SSL verification while configuring credentials through setup page

Note: Enable all the required scripted inputs if it's not already enabled to collect data.

### SSL Configuration:
* The SSL Connection with APIC/MSO is enabled by default. Users first need to create a custom certificate with the proper Domain name and load the updated certificate for SSL verification.
* The procedure to create a custom certificate for Cisco ACI for HTTPS Access is given in below link:
     https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/kb/b_Configuring_Custom_Certificate_for_ACI_HTTPS_Access.html

* To use the new certificate for connection to APIC/MSO from Splunk, follow the below steps:
  * If your script uses python2.7 for data collection:
    * Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests.
    * Add your content at the end of the cacert.pem file.

  * If your script uses python3.7 for data collection:
    * Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME/lib/python3.7/site-packages/requests.
    * Add your content at the end of the cacert.pem file.

* Follow below steps to disable the SSL verification after configuring credentials through setup page:
  * For Password Based Authentication and Remote User Based Authentication:
    * Provide credentials from setup page.
    * passwords.conf file will be created in TA_cisco-ACI/local folder with sample stanza : [credential:x.x.x.x:<apic/mso>,<port>,<user>,True:].
    * Here, the default value of SSL verification will be True.
    * Change this value from True to False.
    * Restart Splunk.

  * For Certificate Based Authentication:
    * Provide credentials from setup page.
    * cisco_aci_server_setup.conf file will be created in TA_cisco-ACI/local folder with sample stanza : [cisco_aci_server_setup_settings,x.x.x.x].
    * Here, the default value of the cisco_aci_ssl parameter will be True.
    * Change this value from True to False.
    * Restart Splunk.

*  This app supports multiple APIC/MSO entries. Provide more ACI credentials through the setup screen. Configure a maximum of 5 APICs for better performance.
*  For Password Based Authentication and Remote User Based Authentication, Splunk REST API will encrypt the password and store it in the app itself(local/passwords.conf) in encrypted form.

  For Certificate Based Authentication, certificate name, and path to the private key will be stored in the app itself(local/cisco_aci_server_setup.conf). 

  The data collector script will fetch these credentials through the REST API to connect to the APIC.

* APIC Hostname or IP address once configured to any 3 modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.

* Also, users can setup APIC either using any one of the three modes of authentication or all the three modes one by one but for different APICs.
  * Example: User can either setup only APIC1 using Password/Remote/Certificate Based Authentication.
                          OR
  Users can setup APIC1 for Password Based Authentication, APIC2 for Remote User Based Authentication and APIC3 for Certificate Based Authentication.

* Note: APIC Hostname or IP address once configured to any 3 modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.

*  Whenever the user wants to change the credentials, he/she needs to remove the current entry from directory TA_cisco-ACI/local/passwords.conf or TA_cisco-ACI/local/cisco_aci_server_setup.conf first.
   Restart Splunk. Provide the credentials through UI.

* MSO Hostname or IP address once configured to any one of the modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.

* Also, users can setup MSO either using any one of the two modes of authentication or all the two modes one by one but for different MSOs.
  * Example: Users can either setup only MSO1 using Password Based Authentication.
                          OR
  Users can setup MSO1 for Password Based Authentication and MSO2 for Remote User Based Authentication.

*  Whenever the user wants to change the credentials, he/she needs to remove the current entry from directory TA_cisco-ACI/local/passwords.conf first. Restart Splunk. Provide the credentials through UI.

* Note: The hostname configured by APIC, cannot be re-configured for MSO and vice versa.
  * Example: If the user can only configure host1 for APIC and host2 for APIC and not host1 for both APIC and MSO.

*  User also needs to modify "default/inputs.conf" according to the following guidelines.

inputs.conf
===============
This file contains filename paths which are different based on your OS platform. 
The app is configured out of the box to work for Unix/Linux/macOS systems. 

If you are running this app on a Windows system, perform the following steps:
  Copy the file "default/inputs.conf.WINDOWS" to "local/inputs.conf"

* Each entry in default/input.conf contains a field "passAuth" with default value admin. This field can contain any splunk user with admin rights.

# Add More Data to Splunk

* Data Inputs (in inputs.conf) can be added/modified either from the setup page or directly from the backend (as mentioned above)

Setup Page
==============
  Following options are provided on the setup page under the tab "Configure Data Inputs" for modifying data inputs in inputs.conf:
  * Type: Following eight types are allowed in Add-on
    * authentication: To get the authentication information from the ACI environment.
    * classInfo: To get the general information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * cloud: To get the details related objects for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * health: To get the health and fault information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * fex: To get the health and fault information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * microsegment: To get the general information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * stats: To get the statistical data for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * mso: To get details of various MSO endpoints.
  * Arguments:  Names of APIC classes for which data will be fetched (Names of classes are case-sensitive) or names MSO API endpoints.
  * Interval: Time interval (in seconds) at which data inputs will be scheduled to collect data, once enabled.
  * Enable/Disable: Status representing whether the data input is enabled or not.
  * Actions:
    * Edit:
      * Add/Remove/Modify the existing APIC classes or MSO endpoints.
      * Change time interval of data inputs.
      * Change status of data inputs i.e. enabled/disabled.
      * Click on Add button (under Actions).
    * Delete
      * This button will directly delete data input.
  * Add New Button: It will add new data input in inputs.conf. Again, the user will have the choice for all actions stated above.
  * Click on save button after making changes.

  Note- Any change performed by the user will be reflected in default/inputs.conf and local/inputs.conf.

# How to enable collector scripts

* Enable Data collector Scripts. By default Scripts are disabled. Enable through UI (Settings -> Data inputs -> Local inputs-> Scripts).
* Enable the collector scripts labeled under the app name: TA_cisco-ACI
* The user can also enable scripts from Setup Page (as mentioned above)


# Create your own index:

	* The app data defaults to the 'main' index.
	* If you need to specify a particular index for your APIC data, for ex. "apic",create an indexes.conf file [sample shown in ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-ACI/default/indexes.conf.sample)]
	* Once you specify your index, edit the inputs.conf file and add a line "index=[yourindex]" under each script stanza.

# TEST YOUR INSTALL / TROUBLESHOOTING

The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned which will populate some of the panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:

    index="<your index>" | stats count by sourcetype

* Troubleshooting APIC configuration:
  * In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
    * cisco:apic:health
    * cisco:apic:stats
    * cisco:apic:class
    * cisco:apic:authentication
    * cisco:apic:cloud
  * If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component="ExecProcessor" collect.py "ACI Error:" | table _time host log_level message

* Troubleshooting MSO configuration:
  * You should see this sourcetype: cisco:mso
  * If you don't see this sourcetype, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect_mso.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component="ExecProcessor" collect_mso.py "MSO Error:" | table _time host log_level message

You can also see the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log file to check if any error has occurred.


# ABOUT THE DATA

#### APIC DATA

You can see what each event looks like by going to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-ACI/bin and executing collect.py with Splunk Python interpreter. 
Example:
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python collect.py -stats fvAp

Each event contains data in the "Field=value" pair. Field names are case sensitive in the Cisco API for APIC. Every event starts with the timestamp and contains the dn(Distinguished Name) field. This field gives a fair idea about the type of information given by the event(health,fault, etc). Like below given dn gives health details for Tenant "abc".

dn="uni/tn-abc/health"

Below are two sample event records. The first one gives health detail for the tenant with the name "common" and the other one gives a fault detail for the same tenant.

1)

2014-04-25 00:38:07     dn=uni/tn-common/health status=created,modified updTs=2014-04-25T04:52:32.274+00:00     chng=0  cur=100 maxSev=cleared  modTs=never     twScore=100     rn=health       prev=100        childAction=    dn=uni/tn-common        lcOwn=local     ownerKey=       name=common     descr=  status=created,modified monPolDn=uni/tn-common/monepg-default   modTs=2014-04-23T22:14:01.702+00:00     ownerTag=       uid=0   rn=tn-common    childAction=    component=fvTenant

#### MSO DATA

You can see what each event looks like by going to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-ACI/bin and executing collect_mso.py with Splunk Python interpreter. 
Example:
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python collect_mso.py -mso policy

Each event contains data in the "Field=value" pair. Field names are case sensitive for the Cisco MSO API. Every event starts with the current_time field which is the machine's current time followed by mso_host (i.e. Hostname of MSO) and mso_api_endpoint (so one can distinguish below various endpoints data). The id field returned in API call is unique for every event.

Below are two sample event records. First one provides details for the policy named common_tenant_policy and the other one for the policy named mso_policy

1)

# DATA GENERATOR
This app is provided with sample data which can be used to generate dummy data. To simulate this sample data, first of all, download the Splunk Event generator, which is available at https://github.com/splunk/eventgen, & needs to be installed at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/. This app generates the dummy data for the ACI environment and populates the dashboards of the main app with the dummy data.
