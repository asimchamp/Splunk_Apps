**Version 1.0.11**

* Fix AppInspect error - Splunk Cloud prohibits the use of UDP inputs.
* Fix AppInspect error - Do not use local.meta; use default.meta instead.
* Fix AppInspect error - Update tcp-ssl configuration.
* Fix AppInspect warning - Do not overwrite default syslog source type.

**NOTE**

Upgrading to this version will remove any TCP and UDP inputs that were previously in use. Customers who rely on TCP and UDP data inputs and wish to continue to do so will have to recreate the data input.

* Go to `Settings > Data inputs > TCP or UDP`
* Click `New` and specify the port data will be received on
* Click `Next` and select a `Source type` of `fw_act` and an `App context` of `Barracuda CloudGenFirewall (BarracudaNGFirewall)`
* Choose the desired `Host` and `Index` settings and click `Review`
* Verify settings and click `Submit`
