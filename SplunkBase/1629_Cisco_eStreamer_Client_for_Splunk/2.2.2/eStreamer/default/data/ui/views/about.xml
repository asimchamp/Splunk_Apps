        <p><b><i>U.S. Government End User Purchasers.</i></b> The Software and Documentation qualify as “commercial items,” as that term is defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) (48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in FAR 12.212. Consistent with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary in any agreement into which the Agreement may be incorporated, Customer may provide to Government end user or, if the Agreement is direct, Government end user will acquire, the Software and Documentation with only those rights set forth in the Agreement. Use of either the Software or Documentation or both constitutes agreement by the Government that the Software and Documentation are “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.</p>
        <p><b><i>Disclaimer of Warranty.</i> THE SOFWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITH NO WARRANTIES. ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CISCO, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS. IN ADDITION, CISCO MAKES NO WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE SPLUNK ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATED THERETO.</b></p>
        <p><b><i>Limitation of Liability.</i></b> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THE AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, ALL LIABILITY OF CISCO, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS COLLECTIVELY, TO CUSTOMER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO ANY APPROVED SOURCE FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR SOFTWARE IS CUMULATIVE AND NOT PER INCIDENT (I.E. THE EXISTENCE OF TWO OR MORE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT).</p>
        <p><b><i>Waiver of Consequential Damages.</i></b> IN NO EVENT WILL CISCO OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY OR WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF CISCO OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that Cisco is providing the Software and Documentation on an “AS-IS” basis and thus has entered into the Agreement in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the same reflect an allocation of risk between the parties (including the risk that a contract remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that the same form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.</p>
        <p><b><i>Controlling Law, Jurisdiction.</i></b> This Agreement is controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of California, United States of America, notwithstanding any conflicts of law provisions; and the state and federal courts of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising under the Agreement.

In addition, if the Agreement is controlled by the laws of England, no person who is not a party to the Agreement shall be entitled to enforce or take the benefit of any of its terms under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

        <p>The parties specifically disclaim the application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek interim injunctive relief in any court of appropriate jurisdiction with respect to any alleged breach of such party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. If any portion hereof is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Except as expressly provided herein, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the license of the Software and Documentation and supersedes any conflicting or additional terms contained in any purchase order or elsewhere, all of which terms are excluded.
