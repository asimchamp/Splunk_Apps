Such APs can be looking out for Clients which probe for hotspot SSIDs. When such a Client is found, the AP can lure the Client into connecting to it. Such connections pose a security threat as Authorized Clients may unwittingly provide confidential information (e.g. passwords) to the External AP over these connections.
