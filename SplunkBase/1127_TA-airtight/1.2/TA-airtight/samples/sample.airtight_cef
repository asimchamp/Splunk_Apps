The AP's details are: MAC address [00:17:DF:AB:8B:10], protocol [802.11 b/g], channel [11], SSID [orange], security setting [802.11i], vendor [Cisco]. Such APs can be looking out for Clients which probe for hotspot SSIDs. When such a Client is found, the AP can lure the Client into connecting to it. Such connections pose a security threat as Authorized Clients may unwittingly provide confidential information (e.g. passwords) to the External AP over these connections. The External AP can also insert itself as a man-in-the-middle for authorized communications using this connection. It can also perform port scanning on the Client to discover its vulnerabilities. ``Hotspotter'' and ``Airsnarf'' are examples of WLAN hacking tools which can be used to launch hotspot attack. rt=Jul 25 2012 16:11:52 UTC dvc=10.98.40.77 AirTightSpectraGuardEnterpriseLocation=//Locations/Florida/Orlando
