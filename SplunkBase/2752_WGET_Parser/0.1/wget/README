To get data into the App, ensure the sourcetpe on import is "wget"

Not that Splunk by default splits events at 257 lines, this needs to be changed for the wget event type

 [WGET]
 NO_BINARY_CHECK = 1
 TIME_PREFIX = --
 pulldown_type = 1
 MAX_EVENTS = 10000

Captures and compares download speeds of WGET - supports Proxy vs Direct analysis

Application parses output of Wget when -o or -a switch is used.

Primary intent is to visual the average and max download times to specific sites.  Focus is on the Connect To line neat the header info, this is used in both direct and Proxy connections, meaning download performance of Proxy vs Direct can be measured.


WGET Command Structure
 - <download> - Placeholder for download data, not used
 - <output> - Output file to be analyse in Splunk
 - <test-url> - URL to test

  --  wget -O <download> -a <output> <test-url>  --
