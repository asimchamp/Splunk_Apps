The script to generate the knowledge object lookup will be run by Splunk automatically.

By default, the script runs every 2 hours, but you can change that in the Splunk Manager (or by changing the settings in inputs.conf).

If you don't want to wait for an updated copy of your knowledge objects, then just run

read_conf_files.py

The script does not take any arguments. It will take around 15 minutes to run on a medium-sized system.
To check on the last execution of the script, look in the logs subdirectory.

The script DOES NOT follow symbolic links. This is to prevent it from "wandering" into other directories on the server. Some
apps, like the pdfserver, use symbolic links to include system libraries, etc. The script will not examine these.
