**`DA-LDAP`**

This is a Splunk Dashboard example for two LDAP Add-on use cases
This dashboard app requires this SA https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1852/
to be installed and configured.

**Install:**

Install as usual in the Splunk web or copy into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps

**Configure:**

Nothing to see here, move along.

**Usage**

You need to configure the included macro to match your environment.

**Support**

This is an open source project, no support provided, but you can ask questions
on answers.splunk.com and I will most likely answer it.

I validate all my apps with appinspect and the log can be found in the README
folder of each app.

Running Splunk on Windows? Good Luck, not my problem.

**Version**
