            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
       
            This is a Splunk Modular Input for executing commands and indexing the output.<br/><br/>

            It is quite simply just a wrapper around whatever system commands/programs that you want to periodically execute and capture the output from ie: (top, ps, iostat, tshark, tcpdump etc...). It will work on all supported Splunk platforms.<br/><br/>

            The Python code in this App is dual 2.7/3 compatible.<br/>
            This version of the App enforces Python 3 for execution of the modular input script when running on Splunk 8+ in order to satisfy Splunkbase AppInspect requirements.<br/>
            If running this App on Splunk versions prior to 8 , then Python 2.7 will get executed.<br/>
