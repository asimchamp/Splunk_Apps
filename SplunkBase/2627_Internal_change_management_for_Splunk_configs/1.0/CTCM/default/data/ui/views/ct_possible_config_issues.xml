      <p>The point of this dashboard is to highlight cases where more than one object exists with the same name but different permission levels. While this might not generally be an issue there is the potential for this to manifest odd behavior that is tough to track down. For example someone may have developed some custom field extractions that only apply to them. Anyone else attempting to use queries or dashboards that leverage those fields will find this content unusable. It could also be an issue when it comes to someone attempting to share a search they made that was initially private.</p>
