<p>
Citrix CloudBridge (http://www.citrix.com/products/cloudbridge/overview.html) accelerates applications and optimizes bandwidth utilization for applications deployed/delivered on private data centers or public clouds. The Splunk for Citrix CloudBridge app provides visibility into the traffic handled by the CloudBridge appliance. CloudBridge generates AppFlow (IPFIX) records that can be consumed and detailed reports generated. The app is intended to highlight the available information and it facilitates customers to adapt it to their needs. The provided set of reports covers the following:
<ul>
<li>Top applications and users</li>
<li>WAN latency measurements</li>
<li>Citrix ICA detailed reports for XenApp and XenDesktop</li>
<li>Compression benefits</li>
</ul>
This data is available at an application, user or per remote branch granularity. The app is supported with Release 7.2 and above of Citrix CloudBridge
