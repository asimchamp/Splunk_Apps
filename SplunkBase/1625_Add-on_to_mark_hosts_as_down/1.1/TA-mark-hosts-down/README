Hello, thanks for using the TA mark hosts down.
This was done on a rainy afternon, during some issues. We needed a 
quick solution to disable alerts for hosts in trouble. 

So this TA was born

NOTE: 
This TA will not crash nor distroy your system, it only uses a 
simple lookup and does not have any data enrichment.

USAGE:
either with some fancy search like this copyrighted by alacer:

earliest=-1m@m sourcetype=iis http_status=500 | stats count by host | where count > 200 | map search=`mark_host_down($host$)`

or simply do a `mark_host_down(serverName)`
or `mark_host_down(serverName serverName2)`

OUT OF SCOPE:
Any data enrichment

MADE out of dragon fire.....
