Nothing too fancy here, this app just provides two commands: dnslookup and serviceslookup

An example search leveraging the netstat data from the *nix app and converting ip addresses into more human friendly dns entries (along with looking up the port servie name in /etc/services)

index=os source=netstat | multikv fields LocalAddress ForeignAddress | rex "(?i)(?P<IP>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})" | rex "(?i)\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}.(?P<PORT>\d+)" | search IP!="*.0" | top IP, PORT limit=0 | dnslookup reverse IP fqdn | serviceslookup PORT SERVICE | table IP, fqdn, PORT, SERVICE, count

dnslookup usage: 

dnslookup <reverse|forward> <input field> <output field>

servicelookup <input field> <output field> <optional services file path>

Hope you find it useful (or if it even works), let me know how you go.
