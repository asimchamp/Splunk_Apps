<h3>Upgrading from versions prior to 3.0.x</h3>
<p>
<b>Note:  This is a complete rewrite of the Splunk App for FireEye to take advantage of the Common Information Model (CIM). It is designed to be compatible
with the data models in the <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1621/" target="_blank">CIM app</a> and <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/263/" target="_blank">Enterprise Security 3.x</a>.</b><br />
You will be able to run the legacy 2.0.X Splunk App for FireEye alongside this version, but it is unnecessary.  This app should render both old and new data. 
</p><br />

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Most users will be able to download and install the application from the <a href="https://apps.splunk.com/" target="_blank">Splunk Apps Marketplace</a>.  However, more complex installations may require an additional download.<br />
As with any Splunk app, there are 2 parts:
<ol>
<li>Data collection</li>
<li>Data visualization/analytics</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br />

<h4>Options</h4>
<p>
For ease of installation and use, the FireEye App for Splunk Enterprise is configured for all data collection by default.

For more complex installations, you may require an extra app known as a Technology Add-on (TA).  TAs are responsible for collecting data and usually do not have any visualizations.  For most installations, FireEye App for Splunk Enterprise contains all of the necessary components.  All others will know what to do.  We made the TA available for separate downloaded to collect data for the various FireEye products.
