          <li>Search heads can be added / removed anytime without bringing down the entire cluster</li>
          <li>Easier to administer the cluster through centralized interface</li>
          <li>Cost effective, no need to buy expensive shared storage system</li>
          <li>No single point failure in the architecture</li>
