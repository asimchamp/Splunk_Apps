These two dataset are small subsets of IMDB and Twitter data.  

For best results in sentiment analysis, train on the same type of
content that it will be run.  Therefore, if you have or can generate
your own training data from your data, you will get the best results.

Each dataset must have two top-level directories [train/, test/]
corresponding to the training and test sets. Each should EITHER have:

  * a subdirectory of the rating expected/desired (e.g., 1/ 2/ 3/ ...)
    with text files with those ratings inside.  Each text file will be
    processed as a separate document.  This is how the IMDB data is
    layed out.

OR 

  * a set of text files with the rating for a name (e.g., 1.txt, 2.txt ...).  
    Each line of the text file is treated as a separate document.
    This is how the twitter data is layed out.
