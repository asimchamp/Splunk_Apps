Small Movie Review Dataset 

The ORIGINAL core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train
and 25k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k
pos and 25k neg). 

THIS DATASET consists of just 10 reviews per rating, as a small sample
to demo the file and directory layout.

There are two top-level directories [train/, test/] corresponding to
the training and test sets. Each has a subdirectory of the rating
expected/desired.
