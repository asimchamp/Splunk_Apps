shortdesc = returns the tokens and phrases from FIELD into the multivalued TOKEN field.
description = returns the tokens and phrases from FIELD into the multivalued\
TOKEN field. Phrases are broken by common English stopwords\
(e.g. the, of, and, etc), meaning they are adjacent, non-stopword\
tokens, which must be at least MINLEN tokens long. \
TYPE=full will better parse non-English characters.\
HIII=true will remove duplicate characters, converting "greeeeeat" to "great".\
Tokens can optionally be stemmed, removing common suffixes for English, as well as deaccented.  FIELD\
defaults to "_raw"; MINLEN defaults to "1" (all non-stopword tokens);\
TYPE defaults to "default"; DEACCENT defaults to false;\
and STEM defaults to "false".
