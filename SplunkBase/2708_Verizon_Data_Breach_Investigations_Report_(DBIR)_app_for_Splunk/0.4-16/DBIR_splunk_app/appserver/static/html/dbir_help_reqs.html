            It turns out that when we all work together, we get things done faster.  Thankfully, Splunk
            has an entire website built for the sole purpose of sharing apps.  Within the DBIR App, there 
            are some add-ons that are necessary and others that could help.  Depending on how you've
            ingested your data, it may be convenient to use objects created in various add-ons or 
            you may want to create the objects yourself to ensure we are pointing directly at 
            your data.  It's your choice.

        If you're reading this page, you've already visited 
        <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/" target="_blank">splunkbase</a> at least once.
        And as you look around you'll see a wealth of interesting add-ons and apps.  When putting 
        together the reports in the DBIR App, we chose to leverage some of these add-ons
        where it made sense.  After all, I'm not sure any of us can improve upon the
        shape of a wheel.

    <h3>SPLUNK'S COMMON INFORMATION MODEL</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most important is the 
        <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/" target="_blank">Splunk Common Information Model</a>.
        We don't like to bandy about words like mandatory very often, but this add-on is a must.  When you're
        monitoring your security situation, you could have data coming from a variety of disparate 
        sources, sources that don't necessarily play well together.  The Common Information Model (CIM)
        provides a way for this data to easily be aggregated into one query, one chart, or one report.
        (And they're pretty thorough with their 
        <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Overview" target="_blank">documentation</a>, too.)

    <h3>SO WHAT DO I INSTALL?</h3>
    <p>
        The following table includes a list of the various apps or add-ons and the construct we are 
        using to make the queries more efficient.  You can choose to implement the construct
        yourself, or use the add-on.

        For the <b>VPN Profile</b> dashboard we are also using a Juniper event type that does not
        come prepackaged (yet) in its own add-on.  If you're importing Juniper data, you'll 
        need to create this event type to see the report populated.

        <p>
            Log in as an administrative user and click on the <em>Settings</em> menu option.  Underneath
            the <em>Knowledge</em> column, you'll see all sorts of contructs.

        <p>
            Follow the links for event types or tags or any other type of object and use the search option
            to location exactly what you're looking for.  You can create your own or expand items that 
            already exist to include your data.  Because, after all, inclusion is a good thing.
