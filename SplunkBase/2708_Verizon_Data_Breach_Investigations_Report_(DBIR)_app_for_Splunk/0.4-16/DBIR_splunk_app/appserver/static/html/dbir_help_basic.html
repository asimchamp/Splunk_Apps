    <p>
        <b>Thank you for downloading and installing the DBIR App for Splunk.  We really appreciate it. 
        Seriously.  But now what do you do?
        It's interesting to look at, but how can you use this app to help your company monitor what is 
        happening to you?  Especially what's happening right now.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>We're glad you asked.</p>
    <p>
        As you know (since you're here already), Splunk offers a wide range of options for querying your
        data and finding those patterns that give a bit of insight into your machine data.  We've tried to 
        do the same.  We've created a series of dashboards using Splunk's
        <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.4/Viz/PanelreferenceforSimplifiedXML" target="_blank">
        Simple XML Dashboard</a> standard, with the focus on simple.  What does this mean for you?
        It means you can update anything in this app to better fit your company and your data.  You have our permission.
        (Just make sure you keep reading to learn how to upgrade to new versions of the DBIR App in the future.)
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="standOut">
        Reports are only as good as the underlying data.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Understanding <em>how</em> the DBIR App queries data will help you decide how best to 
        add your own data into Splunk.  We can't explain to you everything that you can 
        do with Splunk.  Luckily, they have 
        <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk" target="_blank">one</a> or
        <a href="http://answers.splunk.com/" target="_blank">two</a>
        great sites to help you become a Splunk expert yourself.

	<h3>HOW TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE?</h3>
    <div style="float:left; padding-right:25px; padding-bottom:15px">
        <img src="/static/app/DBIR_splunk_app/images/dbir-help-01.png" width="160"
        height="116" title="Open in Search" alt="Open in Search">
    </div>
    <p>
        We'll go into more detail on the <a href="/app/DBIR_splunk_app/dbir_help4">data</a> page, but the best way to determine how to 
        begin...is to start at the end.  In other words, if you want to know how to make your
        data appear in the colorful charts and not so colorful tables take a look at the queries themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every Splunk result set or chart will have a pack of icons on the bottom left that only appear when
        you hover over them.  The first icon (shown) will either say <em>Open in Search</em>
        or <em>Open in Pivot</em>.  If you click that icon, a new window will open and show you
        the exact query that was used to populate the chart or table.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>But what am I looking for?</b>  That's a good question.  We'll do our best to answer that
        on some of the other help pages.  For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/app/DBIR_splunk_app/dbir_help2">add-on</a> help page has a lot of information
            about <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Eventtype" target="_blank">event types</a>
            and <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Tag" target="_blank">tags</a>, including
            some add-ons we think are rather important and others that might just save you some time.
        </li>
        <li>And the <a href="/app/DBIR_splunk_app/dbir_help4">data</a> help page will show you how to
            choose which index to use when importing data.  For instance, email data should be
            imported into an index called <em>email</em>.  We did that on purpose.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    
    <h3>UPGRADING THE DBIR APP</h3>
    <p>
        So you downloaded the app and made a bunch of <a href="/app/DBIR_splunk_app/dbir_help3">customizations</a>  
        and then we released a new version.  What do you do now?
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's the good news:  we won't overwrite your work.  But there's bad news, too:  for every page you 
        change, you won't see our improvements!  Luckily, there's more good news.  Take a look a our 
        <a href="/app/DBIR_splunk_app/dbir_help3">customization</a> help page and we'll show you how to 
        make sure you can keep your changes and include any improvements we've made.  That's what
        we call win-win.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <h3>A NOTE ABOUT DRILLING DOWN</h3>
    <p>
        Splunk does a lot of stuff for us.  That's why we like it.  One of these is the
        <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Tablechartdrilldown" target="_blank">drilldown</a>.
        When you're looking at a chart or a table and you see something that catches your eye,
        all you have to do it click it to "drill down" and get more information.  Usually, this 
        will open up another search in a new window for you, passing the drilldown search as
        a parameter in the URL.  Not to get too technical, but some of these drilldown searches
        can get pretty involved.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, some browsers have a max limit for URL length.  Internet Explorer (IE)
        is one of them.  It limits URLs to 2,084 characters.  We don't believe in limits.  So
        if you are using IE and you drilldown and the page never finishes loading, take a look 
        at the URL because IE may have cut us off right in the middle.  Like, literally, cut
        off the end of the URL.  We don't want to separate you and your data, so thought
        we'd warn you, just in case.
    </p>
