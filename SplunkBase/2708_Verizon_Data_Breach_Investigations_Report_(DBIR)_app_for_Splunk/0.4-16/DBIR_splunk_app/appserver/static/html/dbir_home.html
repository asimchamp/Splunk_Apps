                    The nine patterns, first published in the 2014 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report and later updated in the 2015 DBIR,
                    provide unique breakdowns of security incidents into nine patterns which describe 92% and 96% of security incidents in 2013 and
                    2014, respectively.</p>

                    <h2>Significant Threat Actions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Instead of hitting you with a list of all the threat actions seen this year, we thought we would pare it down to the big
                            movers. Back in 2010, malware was all about the keylogger, and we saw very few examples of phishing or RAM-scraping
                            malware being used. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to today, and RAM scraping has grown up in a big way. This type of malware was
                            present in some of the most high-profile retail data breaches of the year, and several new families of RAM scrapers aimed
                            at Point-of-Sale (POS) systems were discovered in 2014.

                    <h2>Incident Classification Frequency</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the breakdown of incidents by patterns points fingers like an evil monkey at the user, only looking at breaches shifts
                        the blame in a different direction.  POS breaches jump up to the pole position, which shouldn't be too much
                        of a shocker given the headlines of 2014.  Crimeware is still #2. The fact that Cyber-Espionage ranks higher than
                        Insider Misuse and Web App Attacks is rather surprising.   It's hard to discern from the data if that's due to legitimate trends, 
                        contributor foci, low-fidelity data, or a miax of all of the above (probably the latter).

                    <h2>Incident Patterns by Industry</h2>
                    <p>
                        Where as last year’s report asked "Do all organizations share similar threat profiles?", we now want to explore what we
                        believe to be a much better question: <br /><br />"Which industries exhibit similar threat profiles?" <br /><br />Just as our nine patterns
                        helped to simplify a complex issue last year, we believe that answering this question can help clarify the "so what?" question
                        for different verticals.

                        <p>
                            Showing this figure is risky because it may cause more confusion than valid conclusions, but what the heck – we 
                            live on the edge. Although we’d like it to purely reflect changes in the external environment over the years, it more 
                            realistically reflects changes to our data set caused by a rapidly expanding base of contributors. So take whatever 
                            you can from the figure but don’t say we didn’t warn you about the dangers of building your five-year risk projections 
                            around it. View it more like a puzzle that we’re piecing together over time.
