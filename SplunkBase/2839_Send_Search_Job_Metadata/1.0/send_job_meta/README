Description:
First of all 99% of the credit goes to Steve Zhang for creating the actual python script sendjobmeta.py. I've just packaged the app for download and use.
This app will allow you to send search job performance and metadata results to another Splunk instance over TCP.  

Install Instructions:
Untar send_job_meta.spl into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ or install app through GUI.

Use:
... | sendjobmeta ip=<IP> port=<PORT>
Where <IP> is the ip address of your receiving Splunk instance and <PORT> is the port this instance is listening for TCP on. Default Values are ip=127.0.0.1 and port=7090 if you just use "| sendjobmeta".
If you want to change the defaults you can edit sendjobmeta.py in the /send_job_meta/bin directory.

*Note: Make sure the receiving instance is 1) set to be a receiver AND 2) you have set up a data input for listening over TCP on port 7090 (default) or a port of your choice.

Example:
index=_internal | stats count | sendjobmeta
OR
index=_internal | stats count | sendjobmeta ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port=xxxx
