    <h3>TECHNOLOGY ADD-ON FOR NETFLOW APPLICATION CONFIGURATION</h3>
    <p>
      This technology add-on should be installed on your Splunk Search Head, Indexers, and Heavy Forwarders. In previous versions NFO events were inserted into index [flowintegrator]. To use or continue using custom index for your *flow data, please perform the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to Settings->Indexes and if the [flowintegrator] index is not present click on the New Index button, enter <pre><code>    flowintegrator</code></pre> into the Index Name field and click Save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you have SSH access to your Splunk servers, please perform the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create the file if it does not already exist:
                <pre>$SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/indexes.conf</pre>
                and add the following lines to it:
                <pre>[flowintegrator]
homePath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/db
coldPath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/colddb
thawedPath  = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/thaweddb</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              Restart Splunk
            </li>
