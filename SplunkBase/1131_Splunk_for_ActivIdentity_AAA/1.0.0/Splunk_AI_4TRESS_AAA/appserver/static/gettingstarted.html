<h3>Understanding additional Splunk for Cisco Security content</h3>

The landing page of the app provides an overall view of your Cisco security events in real time. While each add-on provides a real time dashboard where applicable the landing page is looking across all Cisco add-ons, plotting the events in real time as they happen as well as providing an overview of the src and dest IP's involved. 
<br>
<br>
There are two Geo views available on the landing page: a real-time view and a cached view of the last 24 hours updated hourly. You may modify this view to include only the events or environments that are of interest to you. In order to modify the schedule or content of the event mapping search you will need:
<br> Open up Manager/Searches and Reports and edit: Cisco Event Map
<br>
<br>If you would like to create additional map content for use in Splunk dashboards please download the Splunk for amMap flash maps add-on and documentation located here: http://www.splunkbase.com/apps/All/4.x/Add-On/app:Splunk+for+use+with+amMap+Flash+Maps
<br>
<br>
<h4>BotNet Overview</h4>
The BotNet Overview dashboard utilizes Cisco Firewall's BotNet filter, providing a view into the latest BotNet activity in your environment.  This dashboard is driven off of a saved search that creates a cache for the dashboard every 3 hours with a Splunk enterprise license.
<br>
To change the schedule or the time frame reported on you can edit the following search under the manager: Cisco BotNet Filter - DataCube
<br>
The BotNet map included with this view is mapping the geo info from the destination IP of the BotNet request. This map is driven off of the results of Cisco BotNet Filter â€“ DataCube.  To make changes to the search schedule or that time frame simply edit the search. 
<br>
<br>
<h4>Global Threat Correlation Overview</h4>
The Global Threat Correlation Overview dashboard is comprised of IPS alerts that surpass defined thresholds for a Global Threat Correlation Score.  By default this is set to 0. This dashboard is driven off of a saved search that creates a cache for the dashboard every 3 hours with a Splunk enterprise license.

To change the schedule, the time frame reported on, or the GTS thresh-hold you can edit the following search under the manager: Cisco IPS Global Threat Correlation - DataCube
