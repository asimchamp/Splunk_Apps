# ABOUT THIS APP

The Cisco ACI App for Splunk Enterprise is used to build dashboards on indexed data provided by the "Cisco ACI Add-on for Splunk Enterprise" app.

This app delivers centralized, real-time visibility for applications and ACI infrastructures across the bare metal and virtualized environments.

# REQUIREMENTS

* Splunk version supported 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 8.0
* This main App requires "Cisco ACI Add-on for Splunk Enterprise" version 5.0.0

# Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment
  
  Install the main app (Cisco ACI App for Splunk Enterprise) and Add-on app (Cisco ACI Add-on for Splunk Enterprise) on a single machine.
* Here both the app resides on a single machine.
* The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it

# Installation of App

* This app can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" or extract zip file directly into /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ folder.
* Restart Splunk.
* Login to Splunk: http://<your_splunk_host:port>
* Open browser: http://<your_splunk_host:port>/en-US/debug/refresh. Click "Refresh"
* Open browser: http://<your_splunk_host:port>/en-US/_bump 
    (To pull all updated web resources from the server to the browser, to modify the cached items such as js, cookies, images etc..)
* Restart Splunk

* Note: 
  1) If the previous version of App is already installed, remove the cisco-app-ACI folder from Splunk app folder before the installation of a newer version or the user can upgrade the app from Splunk UI.
  2) If in case cleaned Splunk eventdata, please make sure to delete the files ending with _LastTransactionTime.txt from TA_cisco-ACI/bin/ folder.
         These files are saving timestamp to get only incremental data from APIC or MSO.

# Installation of Add-on
* This Add-on app can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" or extract zip file directly into /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ folder.
* Ref documentation provided by "Cisco ACI Add-on for Splunk Enterprise" for Configuration of Add-on

* Note: If the previous version of the Add-on app is already installed, remove the TA_cisco-ACI folder from Splunk app folder before installation of a newer version or the user can upgrade the app from Splunk UI.
 If the user upgrades the app, it should be ensured that index, sourcetype, and interval must be mentioned for each input in local/inputs.conf

# Upgradation of App/Add-on
  Please disable all the scripted inputs before upgrading Add-on(TA_cisco-ACI).
* Download the App package
* From the UI navigate to `Apps->Manage Apps`
* In the top right corner select "Install app from file"

  * Search for Cisco ACI App/Add-on
  * Click on `'Update to <version>'` under Version Column.

# Post upgradation steps
####  Upgrading the Add-on(TA_cisco-ACI) to v5.0.0 from any version

Please follow the below steps.

* In inputs.conf file under TA_cisco-ACI/local folder, if stanza containing `'-stats'` is present, then perform the following steps.
  * Change following Classes:
    * eqptEgrTotal5min to eqptEgrTotal15min
    * eqptIngrTotal5min to eqptIngrTotal15min
    * procCPU5min to procCPU15min
    * procMem5min to procMem15min
  * Restart Splunk
    ##### OR
  * Remove that whole stanza and save the file.
  * Restart Splunk

* Follow below steps if you are collecting data using `Certificate Based Authentication` in v4.3.0 OR v4.4.0 and Upgrading Add-on to v5.0.0
  * Take Backup of your Private key.
  * You need to convert your Private key to RSA Private key by running following command in cmd.
    * openssl rsa -in <old_private_key>.key -out <private_key>.key  
      (Keep the name same for newly generated private_key).

* Enable all the scripted inputs.
* Note: If scripts are already enabled then first disable and then re-enable all the scripted inputs.

# Uninstallation of App

  This section provides the steps to uninstall App from a standalone Splunk platform installation.
  
  * (Optional) If you want to remove data from Splunk database, you can use the below Splunk CLI clean command to remove indexed data from an app before deleting the app.
    * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk clean eventdata -index <index_name>
  
  * Delete the app and its directory. The app and its directory are typically located in the folder$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<appname> or run the following command in the CLI:
    * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk remove app [appname] -auth <splunk username>:<splunk password> 
  
  * You may need to remove user-specific directories created for your app by deleting any files found here: $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/etc/users/*/<appname>

  * Restart the Splunk platform. You can navigate to Settings -> Server controls and click the restart button in Splunk web UI or use the following Splunk CLI command to restart Splunk:
    * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart

# TEST YOUR INSTALL

* Once the Add-on app is configured to receive data from ACI, The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is populated in all panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data is to run this search after several minutes:

    index="<your index>" | stats count by sourcetype

* Troubleshooting APIC configuration:
  * In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
    * cisco:apic:health
    * cisco:apic:stats
    * cisco:apic:class
    * cisco:apic:authentication
    * cisco:apic:cloud
  * If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component="ExecProcessor" collect.py "ACI Error:" | table _time host log_level message

* Troubleshooting MSO configuration:
  * You should see this sourcetype: cisco:mso
* If you don't see this sourcetype, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect_mso.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component="ExecProcessor" collect_mso.py "MSO Error:" | table _time host log_level message

You can also see $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log file to check if any error has occurred.

# Additional Features

In addition to out-of-the-box reporting and analytics capabilities for your ACI environment, the app includes a set of pre-defined dashboards for specific user roles:

* Helpdesk admin: Enables Help desk operator to analyze various faults in the system and escalate them to tenant or fabric admin accordingly. He will have access to only "Home", "Authentication" and "Helpdesk" dashboards.

* Tenant admin:  Enables Tenant admin to analyze and drill down faults and health related issues to a particular tenant. He can drill down into Applications, EPGs, and VM endpoints to identify a single point of failure within the admin. He will have access to only "Home", "Authentication" and "Tenants" Dashboards.  

* Fabric admin: Enables Fabric Admin to analyze physical network related issues. It gives visibility into fabric components of networks e.g. leaf, spine and it's physical components like chassis, ports, fan tray, line card, etc.

* Tenant user: Enables Tenant User to manage a specific tenant and all of its components like Application, EPGs ,and VMs. To create a Tenant user for tenant "ABC", follow the steps given below.

1) Create a role with name "tenant_ABC". In search criteria put "dn=uni/tn-ABC/*".
2) Create a new user with the name user-ABC and apply the role of "tenant_ABC" to this user.
3) Edit the permission of Tenant Dashboard to provide read access to a user with the role "tenant_ABC".

* vmware admin: This app has been integrated with the Splunk App for VMware to get the VM details of your datacenter as a client endpoint of APIC. A separate dashboard is provided which can be accessed by splunk_vmware_admin and splunk_vmware_user. Both of these roles are configured with the Splunk App for VMware. You can get a VMware app at https://apps.splunk.com/app/725/ and its documentation https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/VMW/3.0.1/Install/SplunkforVMwareArchitecture.

The app also includes a set of MSO dashboards for specific use cases:

# New Dashboards

* Sites: Information about sites associated with MSO and the fault count of various severity levels. Drill-downs are provided in Site Information, Site Health graph, and panels consisting of fault counts, so users can get a detailed view of the same.

* Schemas: Information about schemas configured with MSO. Drill down into No. of Schemas Associated With MSO single pane visualization will show schema details, drill-down on Application Profiles, Bridge Domain, External EPGs, and VRF single pane visualization to get insights about particular health and fault details and drill-down on contracts will show contracts health details.

* Tenants: Graphical representation of tenants associated with sites, schemas, and users. Drill down on table showing Tenant Details for a particular site will re-direct to Tenant Details dashboard giving more description about the selected tenant. 

* Users: Information about MSO users and their roles. More details about user and roles are given by drill down on Users and Roles panel.

* Policy: Information about policies configured in MSO. Drill down on Policy SubType Breakdown panel will show details of specific subtype.

All the MSO dashboards have Audit Logs panel showing Audit Logs of a particular type, for example, schemas dashboard have audit logs only of type schema.

# Troubleshooting

* If any warning displayed in dashboards of the app stating excessive memory usage of mvexpand command like: `output will be truncated at xxx results due to excessive memory usage...` , user can manually increase the memory limit in limits.conf
* Default value of max_mem_usage_mb parameter is 500 MB. to increase the limit follow below steps.
  * create limits.conf file under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cisco-app-ACI/local
  * Add below stanza:
    [mvexpand]
    max_mem_usage_mb = <non-negative integer in MB>
