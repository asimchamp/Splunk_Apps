      	<p>Have you ever wanted to track down a specific query you wrote in the past, or just browse through your search history? With the Search History feature in the Search app, interacting with your past searches is both easy and effective.</p>

      	<p>Located near the bottom of the Search App home screen (below “How to Search”), Search History will display your 5 most recent ad-hoc search queries when you click “Expand your search history.” With the ability to provide keyword filters to match a specific historical query, set a time constraint, and paginate through additional queries, you should be able to track down a specific search that you entered and either copy/paste its contents or click the “Search” action to run the search. </p>

        <p>Search queries are truncated to fit on a single line, but clicking the “&gt;” icon in the leftmost column will expand long queries to display the full text.</p>
