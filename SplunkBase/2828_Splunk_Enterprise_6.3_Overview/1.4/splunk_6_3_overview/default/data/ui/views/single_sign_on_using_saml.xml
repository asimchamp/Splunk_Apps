        <p>Splunk 6.3 lets you use SAML authentication to setup Single Sign-On. To configure SSO with SAML you must have the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An identity provider. Currently, Ping Identity is the only supported identity provider.</li>
          <li>A configuration that uses an on-premise search head. Currently SSO with SAML is not supported for off-site configurations.</li>
          <li>An admin role with the change_authentication Splunk capability. This permissions level lets you enable SAML and edit authentication settings on a Splunk Search Head.</li>
        </ul>
