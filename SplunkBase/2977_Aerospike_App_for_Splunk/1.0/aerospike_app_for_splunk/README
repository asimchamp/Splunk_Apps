#Describe how to use your application here.

 On launching this app for first time, it redirects the user to setup page. From setup page you can provide IP address of any connected nodes present within the aerospike cluster. This seed node acts as a gateway for getting all Aerospike statistics.

What is in the app:

Homepage : Shows some important charts generated from aerospike statistics like Memory Usage, Disk Usage, Reads per second(RPS), Writes per second(WPS), Connected nodes, Namespaces etc. Additionally it also shows the latency charts of all connected nodes within the cluster.

Statistics : Shows all statistics related to Aerospike Nodes, Namespaces and Cross Datacenter replication also commonly known as XDR.

Setup: Allows the user to change the monitoring of a cluster to a different cluster by provisioning the IP address of any connected node within that cluster.

Search : Allows the user to search any current or historical statistics generated by aerospike.

Alerts : Here we provide some predefined alerts like Memory Usage, Disk Usage ect. User can create custom alerts by selecting create option present on menu bar.

Dashboards : Here the user can create/define their own dashboards.  At first this section is empty allowing any user to create custom dashboards by selecting the Create option.
