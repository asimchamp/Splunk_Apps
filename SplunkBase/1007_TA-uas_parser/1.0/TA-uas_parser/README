App: uas_parser
Author: David Shpritz, Aplura, LLC

NOTE: The data source for this add-on has moved to a subscription service. I
do not plan on updating the add-on for them. This is the last release to remove
the pyc files for use in Splunk Cloud.

This technology add-on provides a dynamic lookup to add fields to user 
agent (browser) data. As user agent string are very difficult to work with,
these fields are intended to make working with these events easier. This 
data is provided by http://user-agent-string.info/ and uses libraries from
that project to provide the fields.

Additional fields include:
os_company: The OS vendor
os_family: The OS family
os_name: The name of the OS
ua_build_version: The build version of the browser
ua_company: The user-agent vendor
ua_family: The user-agent family (Firefox, Safari, IE, etc.)
ua_info_url: A URL to the user-agent-string.info page about the user agent
ua_major_version: Major version of the user agent
ua_minor_version: Minor version of the user agent
ua_name: Full name of the user agent

| Installation
To install:
1. Untar the TA-uas_parser.tar.gz file in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
   diectory.
2. Change to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-uas_parser/bin directory
3. Run "python update_cache.py" to download the data used to generate the
   fields.
4. Restart Splunk.

| Usage
To use:
The lookup expects a field named "http_user_agent". In the search bar,
you can run something like:
index=webdata | lookup uas_lookup http_user_agent

This should produce the additional fields.
