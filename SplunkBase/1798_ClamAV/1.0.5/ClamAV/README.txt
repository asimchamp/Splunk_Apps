# ClamAV app

This app looks at clamav and freshclam log files to report on usage, scan summary, and virus' discovered.

- ClamAV (https://www.clamav.net/). ClamAVÂ® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.
- ClamAV is a registred trademark of Sourcefire, Inc. and Cisco Technology, Inc.

The author of this splunk app has no connection whatsoever with ClamAV, Sourcefire, and or Cisco. Other, than I think it's a f'ing cool product and no-one else has made a splunk app for its logs. :)


# Getting Started

This app has been created to work correctly with a stand-alone, distributed, and cloud installs of Splunk. Read the install notes carefully below with your splunk platform in mind.

You will need two apps:
1. ClamAV     https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1798/
  a. (this app)
2. TA-ClamAV  https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3619/


## New Install

This section is to install on a centralized or stand-alone splunk setup. 

1. Install ClamAV via Splunk UI.
2. Install TA-ClamAV via Splunk UI.
3. Read the index section, below, to enable your correct index settings.
4. Restart the Splunk server.


## Upgrading this app

1. Run the upgrade via the Splunk App management UI.
2. Or use the correct update methodology depending on your distributed design.


## Install for Distributed Splunk designs

For those who are running a distributed Splunk design or HA: ie separate forwarders, search heads, indexers, etc... Please follow these directions, depending on your design YMMV.  Please see this link for more instructions:  [http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Installingadd-ons]

  
1. Install this App on your Search head(s).
2. See the README.txt notes to install the TA-ClamAV app on the remaining systems.


## Install for Splunk Cloud

I have not used Cloud yet. I believe you install this app via the UI.
Also install the TA-ClamAV app via the UI.

The TA app will control your index settings.
