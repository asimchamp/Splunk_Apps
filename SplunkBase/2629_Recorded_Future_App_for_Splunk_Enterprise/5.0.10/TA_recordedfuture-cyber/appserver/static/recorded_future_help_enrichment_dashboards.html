<html><body><div><h1>Enrichment Dashboards</h1>

<p>The Recorded Future Enrichment Dashboards use the Recorded Future API to 
fetch all information about an entity, such as IP address or domain. </p>

<p>The different types of Enrichment dashboards may contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rf-field">Summary</span> shows a short summary of the collected 
information.</li>
<li>The Risk meter graphically displays the current risk score.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Triggered Risk Rules</span> show the rules that have 
been triggered.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Total Reference Count</span> shows the number of 
references collected over time.</li>
<li>Context of up to 15 different category types related to the entity, 
such as Related Attacker, Related Malware, and Related Technologies.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">References</span> contain two tables showing recent 
and first references.</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual elements displayed depend on the type of entity and on the 
information available. Any elements that do no contain any information will 
not be displayed. </p>
