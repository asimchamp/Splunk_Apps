<html><body><div><p>A <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/macrosconf">macro</a> 
is defined in a configuration file called macros.conf, usually bundled with a 
Splunk Application. Most macros that are bundled with the Recorded Future App 
for Splunk handle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> objects 
returned from the Recorded Future Connect API. </p>

<p>For instance, the macro called 'rf_hits' may need to be modified for the 
correlations in the Correlation Dashboards to work. (whatever is specified in 
the fourth line)</p>

<pre>
    [rf_hits(1)]
    args = infield
    definition = dedup $infield$ \
    | lookup rf_ip_threatfeed Name as $infield$ OUTPUT Name as RF_Hit, Risk, RiskString, EvidenceDetails \
    | search RF_Hit=* \
    | eval Rule = spath(EvidenceDetails,"EvidenceDetails{}.Rule") \
    | eval EvidenceString = spath(EvidenceDetails,"EvidenceDetails{}.EvidenceString")
