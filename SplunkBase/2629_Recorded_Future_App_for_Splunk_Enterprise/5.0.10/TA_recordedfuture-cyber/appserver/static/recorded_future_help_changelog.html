<h3>New</h3>

<ul>
<li>New enrichment dashboards
<ul>
<li>URLs</li>
<li>Malwares</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New correlation dashboard:
<ul>
<li>URLs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A new Explorer dashboard has been added. Using drop-down menus it's
possible to explore different sourcetypes, risklists and fields
to find the best way to correlate event data.</li>
<li>A new Global Map dashboard was added.</li>

alerts pulled from Recorded Future using the alerts modular input.</li>
<li>Support for Custom risklist using Recorded Future Fusion was added. Any
number of risklists can be added.</li>
<li>New macros:
<ul>
<li>rf_correlate - extends the functionality of previously available
rf_hits with support for multiple risklists. This macro does
however not unpack and format the evidence string. The new macro
format_evidence can be used for this.</li>
<li>format_evidence - unpacks and reformats the evidence details for a
matching entity.</li>
<li>to_date - extract the date from data and formats it.</li>
<li>to_time - extract the date and time from data and formats it.</li>
<li>to_splunk_time - extract the date and time but perform no
formatting.</li>

enrichment.</li>

used to verify that the app can work or to gather information
about potential issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Search head cluster synchronization:
<ul>
<li>Only one cluster member retrieves risklists before distributing
them to the rest of the cluster.</li>
<li>Configuration is synchronized, ex the API key can be added to
any node in the cluster, it will be propagated to all nodes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Correlation dashboards have been improved:
<ul>
<li>The Triggered Rules and Evidence strings that were previously
shown in two different fields have now been combined into one,
making it much easier to match Risk Rule with the corresponding
Evidence String. For each event the Evidence is listed in
descending criticality. A colored dot also provides information
about how critical the evidence is.</li>
<li>An addtional column has been added to the table of events found
in the correlation search: the count of occurences of the entity
(ex IP).</li>
<li>Two additional panes have been added:
<ul>
<li>The top Risk Rules over the last 24 hours.</li>
<li>The top entity (ex IP) which matches the risk list
during the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enrichment dashboards have been improved:
<ul>
<li>To help focus on the most relevant information the respective
dashboard mimics the corresponding information card from Recorded
Future.</li>
<li>The "Current Risk Indicators" panel has been renamed to
"Triggered Risk Rules". The content is sorted by descending
Criticality (which is shown and color coded).</li>
<li>When Recorded Future has information that the entity is present
on a Treat list this information is shown in the "In Threat Lists"
panel.</li>
<li>If Recorded Future's Insikt Group has produced research about
the entity this is shown in the "Threat Research Insikt Group" panel.</li>
<li>The number of categories of related entities has been
increased. Only panels with information are shown. The following
categories have been added:
<ul>
<li>Related Attacker</li>
<li>Related Target</li>
<li>Related Actors</li>
<li>Related Products</li>
<li>Related Countries</li>
<li>Related Technologies</li>
<li>Related E-Mail Addresses</li>
<li>Related Attack Vectors</li>
<li>Related Operations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some dashboards have been made more efficient by removing
additional API calls.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recorded Future Cyber Vulnerability Enrichment has been improved:
<ul>
<li>Information from NVD is displayed in the "NVD Summary" panel.</li>
<li>Information about affected versions is shown in the "Affeced
Versions" panel.</li>
<li>Information third party information is shown in the "Advisories,
Assessments and Mitigations" panel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The filenames of the risklists in the the lookups folder have
changed. Ex: rf_ip_threatfeed.csv has become rf_ip_risklist.csv. The
transform used to map between the name and the file name has been
adapted to ensure backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>Complete rewrite of the scripts included in the app.
<ul>
<li>Updates of the risklists and retreival of alerts have been
implemented as modular inputs to improve reliability and
scalability. Updates are performed as soon as new versions of the
risklists become available. </li>
<li>Enrichment is performed using an extension of Splunk's REST
endpoint.</li>
<li>The setup GUI has been extended and leverages Splunk's
framework.</li>
</ul></li>
