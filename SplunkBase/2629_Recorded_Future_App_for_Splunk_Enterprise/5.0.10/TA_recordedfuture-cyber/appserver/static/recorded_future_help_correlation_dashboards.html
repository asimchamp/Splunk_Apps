<html><body><div><h1>Correlation Dashboards</h1>

<p>The Correlation Dashboards display correlations between events and Recorded
Future Risk Lists. The Risk List used for the correlation depend on which type
of Correlation Dashboard is chosen. By default only the events of the last 
24 hours are used. </p>

<p>The Correlation Dashboards need to be configured to ensure that the events used 
contain the correct type of entity, for instance that the IP address Risk
List is matched to events that contain IP addresses. </p>

<p>The correlation dashboards contain four elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rf-field">Summary</span> shows the number of entities which were
found to match one or more events.</li>
<li>"Top Rule Hits" shows the rules which are triggered by these entities.</li>
<li>"Top Counts" displays the the entities with the number of events they were
matched to.</li>
<li>"High Risk" contains matching entities with the risk information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dashboard Sections</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><span class="rf-field">Summary</span> displays the number of the events for 
which a match was found in the Risk List.</p>

<h3>Top Rule Hits</h3>

<p>Section "Top Rule Hits" contains a list of all Recorded Future Rules that have 
been triggered by the matching entities and is sorted by the number of entities 
that have triggered the rule.</p>

<h3>Top Counts</h3>

<p>Section "Top Counts" lists all the entities were matched to the events and the
list is sorted by the number of events that the entity was matched
to. Click on an entity to bring up its corresponding Enrichment Dashboard in a 
new window.</p>

<h3>High Risk</h3>

<p>This is a table with the matched entities listed in descending Risk order. The 
Risk column is ordered and color coded according to the risk score. </p>

<p>Further information can be obtained by two drill down options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click on the entity, such as the IP address or the Domain, to open a new
Search window looking for events involving the entity.</li>
<li>Click on any other part of the line to open the Enrichment Dashboard for the
entity.</li>
</ul>
