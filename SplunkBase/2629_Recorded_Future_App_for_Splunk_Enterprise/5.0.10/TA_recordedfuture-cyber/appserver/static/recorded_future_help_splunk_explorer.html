<html><body><div><h1>Splunk Explorer Dashboard</h1>

<p>The Splunk Explorer Dashboard is found under <span class="rf-field">Other &#8594; 
Splunk Explorer Dashboard</span>. It is designed to perform a quick correlation
between the Recorded Future Risk Lists and a subset of Splunk events. The 
Dashboard uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> 
call to find all the available <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Lookup">lookup</a> 
files in the lookups folder within the Splunk App. </p>

<p>To perform a new correlation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select a Risk List in the first drop down menu.</li>
<li>Select one of the available source types, specified in the local install, in 
the second drop down menu.</li>
<li>The fields contained in third drop down menu depends on the source type. 
The correlation will start automatically when the field is chosen. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following panels show the result of the correlation: </p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rf-field">Current Entity Risk List Size</span> shows the number
of items in the selected Risk List.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Events with the Selected Values</span> displays the 
number of events in Splunk which contain the selected source type and field 
during the last 36 hours.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Recorded Future Match Count of Selected Values</span>
contains the number of events where the chosen field matches one item in the 
Risk List.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Most Active Selected Values</span> displays the 
most frequently occurring values in the selected field and source type.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Recorded Future Matches Details of Selected 
Values</span> shows the correlated matches enriched with information from the
Risk List.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example screenshot of the Splunk Explorer Dashboard using an IP 
address Risk List combined with firewall logs/dst as source type/field where 
dst typically stands for destination IP address. </p>
