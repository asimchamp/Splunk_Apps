<html><body><div><h1>Alert Monitoring Setup</h1>

<p>There is no default configuration for alert monitoring. Alert monitoring is 
configured in <span class="rf-field">Configuration &#8594; Configuration &#8594; Alerting Rules</span>. </p>

<p>When monitoring alerts, the Recorded Future App will poll the Recorded Future 
API for alerts which match the configured criteria.</p>

<p>By default, the alerts are fetched on the fly when needed by a dashboard.</p>

<h2>Add Alert Monitoring</h2>

<p>To add alert monitoring, click on <span class="rf-field">Add Alerting Rule</span> and 
select the Alerting Rule to fetch alerts from. The following fields then appear:</p>
