<html><body><div><h1>Alert Dashboards</h1>

<p>The Alert Dashboard displays current alerts. Alerts are retrieved from the 
Recorded Future API when the Alert dashboard is accessed or refreshed.</p>

<p>By default the sum of all configured inputs for alerts are shown but 
specific inputs can be selected using the drop down menu 
<span class="rf-field">Select an Alert config</span>.</p>

<p>The dashboard contains three fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rf-field">Number of Alerts</span> shows how many alerts that are currently active.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Counts by Rule</span> displays how many times an alert rule has been triggered.</li>
<li><span class="rf-field">Detailed Alert Information</span> with further information of the alerts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on an alert in <span class="rf-field">Detailed Alert Information</span> 
to open a new window showing the alert in Recorded Future Portal.</p>
