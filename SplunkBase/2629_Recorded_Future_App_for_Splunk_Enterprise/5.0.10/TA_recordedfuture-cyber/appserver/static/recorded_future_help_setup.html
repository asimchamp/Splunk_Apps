<html><body><div><h1>Initial Setup of the App</h1>

<p>When the app has been installed on the Splunk server, finalise the initial 
setup under <span class="rf-field">Configuration &#8594; Configuration</span>.</p>

<p>The Configuration view has three panes: Setup, Risk Lists and Alerting Rules.</p>

<p>Configure the API-key with Connect API access and a working API endpoint under 
the <span class="rf-field">Setup</span> view.</p>

<p>The <span class="rf-field">API-key</span> must be configured in the Setup pane in order for 
the app to work. A user needs the capability of 'list_storage_passwords' to
configure API key and Proxy settings in the App. </p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p><img src="/static/app/TA_recordedfuture-cyber/img/recorded_future_setup_view.png" alt="Setup tab" title="Proxy setup tab"></p>

<p>Here all the settings except for Risk Lists and Alerting Rules are configured.
The minimum possible configuration is setting the API-key here.</p>

<p>If you need to disable certificate validation, for example if a networking device
in between the Splunk machine and the internet is modifying the SSL certificate, this
can be done by unchecking the "SSL Verification" checkbox. </p>

<p>If the splunk server requires a proxy for Internet access, the 
<span class="rf-field">Proxy</span> checkbox should be checked. 
This will reveal new fields that need to be filled in. The 
username and password should only be configured if the proxy requires 
authentication. Proxy host and port are required settings.</p>

<p>Recorded Future support may in rare circumstances instruct a user to use a 
different URL to the Recorded Future API, in which case the 
<span class="rf-field">Recorded Future API URL</span> should be modified.</p>

<p>There are five levels of logging: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG. </p>

<p>The recommended log level is INFO. To report an issue with the Recorded 
Future App, temporarily change it to DEBUG to collect additional logs that can 
be used for trouble shooting. </p>

<p>The logs generated by the Recorded Future App are located in the default 
Splunk log directory <span class="rf-field">$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk</span> 
and will be written to the following file:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rf-field">ta_recordedfuture_cyber_rest.log</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The information contained in the log files can be viewed either in the Splunk 
GUI or as files on the Splunk server.</p>

<p>Example search:</p>

<pre><code>index=_* source="/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/ta_recordedfuture_cyber_rest.log"
</code></pre>

<p>More information about the other tabs can be found under their respective help pages.</p>
