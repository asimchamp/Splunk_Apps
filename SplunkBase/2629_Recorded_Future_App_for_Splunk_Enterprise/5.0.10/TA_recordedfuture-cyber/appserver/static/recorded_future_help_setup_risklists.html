<html><body><div><h1>Configure and Manage Risk Lists</h1>

<p>Risk Lists can be used to correlate and enrich events. Each element in 
a Risk List, like an IP number or Domain, contains has a risk score and the 
information which contributed to its risk score. </p>

<h2>Default Risk Lists</h2>

<p>The Recorded Future App is shipped with the five Recorded Future Risk Lists:</p>

<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Domain names</li>
<li>URLs</li>
<li>Hashes of files</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities (mainly CVEs)</li>
</ul>

<p>With Fusion access, it is possible to work with customized Risk Lists.</p>

<h1>Special Considerations for Recorded Future App on Splunk ES</h1>

<p>Both Recorded Future App for Splunk and Recorded Future App for Splunk ES fetch 
the same set of default Risk Lists. To avoid unnecessary credit consumption and 
processing load, it is recommended to access the Risk Lists through Recorded
Future App for Splunk ES and to disable them in Recorded Future App for Splunk.</p>
