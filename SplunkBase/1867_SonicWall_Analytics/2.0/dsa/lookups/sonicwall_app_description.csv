H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which defines multimedia communications over Local Area Networks (LANs) without a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). These networks are prevalent in todays corporate desktops and include packet-switched TCP/IP over Ethernet. H.323 suite of protocols form an important building blocks for a broad new range of collaborative, LAN-based applications for multimedia include parts of H.225.0 - RAS, Q.931, H.245 RTP/RTCP and audio/video codecs, such as the audio codecs (G.711, G.723.1, G.728, etc.) and video codecs (H.261, H.263) that compress and decompress media streams. Media streams are transported on RTP/RTCP. RTP carries the actual media and RTCP carries status and control information. The signalling is transported reliably over TCP.  The H.225 call signaling protocol consists of many subprotocols and is part of the H.323 suite. H.225 is used for connection establishment and termination between endpoints. The H.225 call signaling protocol also supports status inquiry, ad hoc multipoint call expansion, and limited call forwarding and transfer. H.225 call signaling messages are exchanged over Q.931. The Q.931 messages are exchanged over a TCP stream demarcated by Transport Protocol Data Unit Packet (TPKT) encapsulations. The H.225 call signaling message is transported as part of the user information element of the Q.931 protocol. The ASN.1 representation of the H.225 message is encoded using the Packed Encoding Rules. H.225.0 v2 is a standard which covers narrow-band visual telephone services defined in H.200/AV.120-Series Recommendations. It specifically deals with those situations where the transmission path includes one or more packet based networks, each of which is configured and managed to provide a non-guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) which is not equivalent to that of N-ISDN such that additional protection or recovery mechanisms beyond those mandated by Rec. H.320 is necessary in the terminals. H.225.0 describes how audio, video, data, and control information on a packet based network can be managed to provide conversational services in H.323 equipment. H.245 is a control channel protocol for use with H.323 sessions. H.245 is connected with the line transmission of non-telephone signals. It also offers the possibility of being tunneled within H.225.0 call signaling messages."

H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which defines multimedia communications over Local Area Networks (LANs) without a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). These networks are prevalent in todays corporate desktops and include packet-switched TCP/IP over Ethernet. H.323 suite of protocols form an important building blocks for a broad new range of collaborative, LAN-based applications for multimedia include parts of H.225.0 - RAS, Q.931, H.245 RTP/RTCP and audio/video codecs, such as the audio codecs (G.711, G.723.1, G.728, etc.) and video codecs (H.261, H.263) that compress and decompress media streams. Media streams are transported on RTP/RTCP. RTP carries the actual media and RTCP carries status and control information. The signalling is transported reliably over TCP.  The H.225 call signaling protocol consists of many subprotocols and is part of the H.323 suite. H.225 is used for connection establishment and termination between endpoints. The H.225 call signaling protocol also supports status inquiry, ad hoc multipoint call expansion, and limited call forwarding and transfer. H.225 call signaling messages are exchanged over Q.931. The Q.931 messages are exchanged over a TCP stream demarcated by Transport Protocol Data Unit Packet (TPKT) encapsulations. The H.225 call signaling message is transported as part of the user information element of the Q.931 protocol. The ASN.1 representation of the H.225 message is encoded using the Packed Encoding Rules. H.225.0 v2 is a standard which covers narrow-band visual telephone services defined in H.200/AV.120-Series Recommendations. It specifically deals with those situations where the transmission path includes one or more packet based networks, each of which is configured and managed to provide a non-guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) which is not equivalent to that of N-ISDN such that additional protection or recovery mechanisms beyond those mandated by Rec. H.320 is necessary in the terminals. H.225.0 describes how audio, video, data, and control information on a packet based network can be managed to provide conversational services in H.323 equipment.

1804,Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI),"Distributed systems require that computations running in different address spaces, potentially on different hosts, be able to communicate. For a basic communication mechanism, the JavaTM programming language supports sockets, which are flexible and sufficient for general communication. However, sockets require the client and server to engage in applications-level protocols to encode and decode messages for exchange, and the design of such protocols is cumbersome and can be error-prone.An alternative to sockets is Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which abstracts the communication interface to the level of a procedure call. Instead of working directly with sockets, the programmer has the illusion of calling a local procedure, when in fact the arguments of the call are packaged up and shipped off to the remote target of the call. RPC systems encode arguments and return values using an external data representation, such as XDR.RPC, however, does not translate well into distributed object systems, where communication between program-level objects residing in different address spaces is needed. In order to match the semantics of object invocation, distributed object systems require remote method invocation or RMI. In such systems, a local surrogate (stub) object manages the invocation on a remote object.The Java platform's remote method invocation system described in this specification has been specifically designed to operate in the Java application environment. The Java programming language's RMI system assumes the homogeneous environment of the Java virtual machine (JVM), and the system can therefore take advantage of the Java platform's object model whenever possible."

1829,Google Chrome Data Compression Proxy,"Google Chrome Data Compression Proxy -- Faster, safer, and cheaper mobile web browsing with data compression.  The latest Chrome browsers for Android and iOS can significantly reduce cellular data usage by using proxy servers hosted at Google to optimize website content – this feature has been shown to reduce the size of web pages by 50%. To enable it, visit \"Settings > Bandwidth Management > Reduce data usage\" and toggle the option – easy as that.  The core optimizations that allow us to reduce overall data usage are performed by Google servers. When the Data Compression Proxy feature is enabled, Chrome Mobile opens a connection between your phone and one of the optimization servers running in Google's datacenters and relays all non-encrypted HTTP requests over this connection.  The proxy server receives the request initiated on the mobile device, initiates a request for the required resource on your behalf, and then optimizes each response before delivering it back to the client. The content optimization is performed by our open-source PageSpeed libraries, which are specifically tuned for the Chrome Mobile browser. The rendering of the page, and all JavaScript execution, is performed by the client’s browser. Secure connections (HTTPS) are routed directly from your mobile device to the destination, bypassing the compression proxy. The use of the compression proxy does not require a Google account."
