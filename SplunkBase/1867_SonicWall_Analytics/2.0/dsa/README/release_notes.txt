oct-27 fixed two typos in the install instructions
sept-30 changed /lookups/sonicwall_hostnames.csv to sonicwall_firewalls.csv . Created a scheduled report that searches for host and generates this file. This fixes the multi select element on the applications dashboard that was searching by the firewall_hostname instead of by host. Users can now edit this file and name their firewalls. Changes to the file will not be overwritten. New entries are added to the end automatically by saved search
