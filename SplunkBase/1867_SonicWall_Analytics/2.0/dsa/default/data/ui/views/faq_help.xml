          <h2>Applications Dashboard displays nothing</h2>
          <p>The $SPLUNK_HOME/dsa/lookups/sonicwall_firewall.csv lookup file does not include your firewall IP/name in it.
            To fix this, manually run the SonicWALL Firewalls Report as detailed in the installation instructions.

          <h2>Total data sent does not appear correct</h2>
          <p>There is a known bug present in the 6.x versions where connections that have timed out (insted of FYN)
             are not reported through IPFix Connection Closed. We are working on making the bug fix for this available. 
             In the meantime, you should not consider the total data values accurate.
          </p>
          <h2>Threats blocked is 0</h2>
          <p>To see a non-zero number, you can download a test/sample virus payload to stimulate the firewall.
