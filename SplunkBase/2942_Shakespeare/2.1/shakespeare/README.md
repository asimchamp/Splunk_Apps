Shakespeare App - James Donn

==================
While I was having a few pints with my colleagues they said:

	"We get that Splunk can analyze machine data, but show how it handles other things."

	"What do you really want to see?"

	"Index all of Shakespeare's works and tell me how many times 'Alas, poor ...'  is used."

Luckily, "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare by William Shakespeare" has already been put into a single text document via Project Gutenberg - http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100.  Getting that data into Splunk is easy.  

This Splunk App simply indexes that data and analyzes the text.  It will create a Shakespeare index
for this. It also provides the means to read all of Shakespeare's works in Splunk! =)

For extra fun, I combined several "potentially offensive" word lists and compare them with each one of Shakespeare's works.  

While this is all for fun, you can reuse these analytics techniques on any data - both machine data and text created by humans.
