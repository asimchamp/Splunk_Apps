description = sendresults is an immensely powerful, life-changing Splunk command and alert action developed by Discovered Intelligence that allows you to send tabulated search results to individuals dynamically, based upon the data within the results. This means that you no longer need to hardcode an email into the search, but can evaluate the email instead from an `email_to` field.
