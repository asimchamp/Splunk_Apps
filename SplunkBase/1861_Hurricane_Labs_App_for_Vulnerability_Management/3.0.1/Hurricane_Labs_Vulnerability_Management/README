                Hurricane Labs App for Vulnerability Management

  What is it?
  -----------
  
  The Hurricane Labs App for Vulnerability Management is designed to view vulnerability
  data presented in the Splunk CIM format for Vulnerabilities. This app can be used with
  the Hurricane Labs Add-On for Nessus, the Hurricane Labs Add-On for QUALYS, and any
  other CIM compliant Vulnerability add-on.
  
  The app also provides a view for pulling more information about the plugins used by
  scanners. This view is NOT CIM compliant, and will currently only work with the
  Hurricane Labs Add-On for Nessus and the Hurricane Labs Add-On for QUALYS.
