        <h1>Error: Sideview's Canary app is required to run that dashboard ($dashboard_name$) in Splunk 8.X and up, but Canary is missing.</h1>

        <p>
          If you are reading this, there is a good chance that you recently upgraded Splunk to 8.X, and you navigated to an old view/dashboard that had been created with the "Sideview Utils" app.   However you (or your administrators) didn't know that you have to first install Sideview's "Canary" app.  This is OK and here's how to fix it:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://sideviewapps.com/apps/canary/" target="_blank">Read a bit more about the Canary app here</a>.</li>

          <li>Install the Canary app on your Splunk instance (more specifically on just the SH tier).  It is available from <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4697/" target="_blank">Splunkbase</a> or from the <a href="https://sideviewapps.com/apps/canary/" target="_blank">Sideview website</a>.</li>

          <li>After Canary is installed, but before just navigating to your old views and dashboards, it's best to navigate to the Canary app itself.  It offers tools on its landing page to check all of the Sideview-Utils views across all your apps for any compatibility issues with Canary.  These tools will tell you which views should run just fine with no modification, and which views might need some manual migration.  It will even give you some detail about what part it doesn't like and how to go about fixing it.</li>
