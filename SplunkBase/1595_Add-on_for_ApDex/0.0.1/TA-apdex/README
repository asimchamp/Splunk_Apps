Using this Add-on
----------------------------------------

This add-on is designed to work with data that has a time_taken field.

To use this add-on, search for any data with a time_taken field, and pipe to the
apdex macro, with a threshold.

For example, for data with a sourcetype of access_combined, with time_taken measured
in milliseconds and a threshold of one second:

    sourcetype=access_combined | `apdex(1000)`

Additionally the apdex_categories macro will give the broken out numbers for 
satisfied, frustrated and tolerating users.
