IDS Rule Reference:
Provides visibility into Snort/PulledPork .rules files and Snort VRT 
rule documentation for tuning and general reference.

Install:
Download the Snort Rule Documentation (opensource.gz) from 
  http://www.snort.org/snort-rules
Extract opensource.gz:
  tar zxvf opensource.gz -C /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ids_ref/local/rules
Copy your Snort PulledPork *.rules files: 
  cp *.rules /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ids_ref/local/rules/
Restart Splunk.

Event Workflows:
You can modify the Event Workflows from Splunk Manager > Fields > 
Workflow actions. Edit the IDS Rule Reference entries' "Apply only 
to the following fields" to apply the workflow link to your Snort sig_id 
field in Splunk (sig_id, the default, for Security Onion users).

Note to Security Onion for Splunk users: install this app for the extra 
visibility into your IDS Rules data. Just disable the inputs in 
/opt/splunk/etc/apps/ids_ref/default/inputs.conf to leverage your 
existing Security Onion IDS Rules Reference setup.

Feel free to send comments/thoughts/suggestions.
