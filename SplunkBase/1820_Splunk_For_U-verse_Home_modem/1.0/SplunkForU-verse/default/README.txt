== SplunkForUverse App ==

The SplunkForUverse App is available for download on Splunk Apps (http://apps.splunk.com) and is packaged as a standard Splunk application.  The primary goal of the application is to parse inbound syslog data generated by the AT&T U-verse modem and display the reults in a single UI.  The firewall data details who is knocking on your door and who is making into your network if you have pinholes configured that allow to to share internal services to the internet.

The SplunkForUverse app provides the following:

1.  Categorization of events into distinct eventtypes to make search for just "firewall" or "voice" events easier.
2.  A Single default dashboard that provides a high level overview of the system.  A couple of the panels may take a few seconds to load because reverse DNS looksups are being performed on firewall related source IP addrsses.
3.  Pre-defined scheduled searches.  If you have your system configured to relay mail, you send send yourself daily reports.
4.  Extractions via props.conf that parse the messages

== Dependencies ==
None, other than getting your data input setup correctly (manual source and sourcetype assignment).

== System Requirements ==
This App has been tested to function on 64 bit Linux installs running a 6.X version of Splunk as well as on Windows.  The U-verse modem used to generate events:  Manufacturer=Pace Plc, Model 3800HGV-B, Hardware Version=2700-100531-006, and Software Version=6.11.1.29-plus.tm.  The events that are being generated by the model have the following general format:  "Apr 19 10:31:30 192.168.1.254 Apr 19 10:32:43 192.168.1.254 .............". 

==  Modem Configuration ==
1.  Log into your AT&T U-verse modem via the https interface
2.  Click on the Settings tab
3.  Click on the Diagnostics tab
4.  Click on the Syslog tab
5.  Set the Server Address to be the IP Address of your Splunk indexer
6.  Set the Server Port to be the custom UDP port that your indexer is configured to listen on

== SplunkForUverse App Configuration ==
1.  Create a Data Input (Settings->Data Inputs->UDP) to receive the syslog events from the modem on a unique port number.
2.  Make sure your source and sourcetype for the above input is set to "u-verse" (without the quotes).  The eventtypes depend on sourcetype=u-verse and the dashboards depend on source=u-verse.  This is done to make life easier when dumping the incoming u-verse events into you main index.
