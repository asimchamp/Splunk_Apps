description=Renders a multi-column picker based on a search.

[param:columns]
required = False
label = List of column definitions.  Each column is a param, named for the field that is being presented by the upstream search.  Each column can have a number of parameters, including:<ul><li><b>title</b> - the title of the column</li><li><b>weight</b> - a weighting for the position of the column</li></ul>

[param:drilldownPrefix]
required = False
default = click
label = Since this defaults to 'click', by default the keys will come down in the context as 'click.name', 'click.value', 'click.name2', 'click.value2'. In cases where you are nesting multiple drilldown patterns in the same view, this key is used so that the second set of keys does not collide with the first. For example if you have a nested config you might set the first to "userClick", and the second to "applicationClick".

[param:count]
required = False
default = 5
label = Sets the height of the column picker, in rows.

[param:autoSelector]
required = False
default = none
label = When the user clicks on a selection, this parameter controls what happens.  Normally (or if this param is 'none'), nothing else happens.  If the param is 'rtl', then any column to the left that matches the underlying search will be auto-selected.  If the param is 'ltr', then any column to the right that matches the underlying search will be auto-selected.  If the param is 'both', then all columns will be auto-selected.

[param:defaultState]
required = False
default = true
label = Default state of the selections, if no other method of selection is found.  Pick either "true" for selected, or "false" for not selected.

[param:loadFromCookie]
required = False
default = false
label = If true, this loads the default state from a cookie.  If the cookie does not exist, then defaultState is used instead.  Note that setting this also sets the cookie.

[param:cookieName]
required = False
default = BDColumnSelector
label = If we are loading the default state from a cookie, this is the name of the cookie to load.
