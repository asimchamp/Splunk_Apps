Farm-Friendly Naming

Edit the file FarmNames.csv.  Each line should contain one Farm 
specified by Id and it's "friendly" name.  For example

FarmId,FarmName
730eee5b-de80-4b27-9b11-d8ff7aca7509,Production
aeeeb157-e531-4969-9f54-8050a1dbc001,Development

The FarmId must be listed as the Id in the SPFarm.csv lookup and the
FarmName can be anything you want.  Use standard CSV formatting (i.e.
quote if necessary).


Office Locations

Edit the file OfficeLocations.csv.  Each line should contain a CIDR
block and a friendly name for the office.  For example:

c_ip,office,office_lat,office_lon
10.155.80.0/24,New York,40.6700,73.9400
10.155.82.0/23,San Francisco,37.7833,122.4167
10.155.84.0/24,Bethesda,38.9847,77.1131
10.155.85.0/28,Seattle,47.6097,122.3331
10.155.85.16/28,Denver,39.7392,104.9847
10.160.0.0/16,VPN,,

Note the VPN field.  This is how we associate the VPN access dashboards. 
Ensure that the VPN concentrator IP address range is called "VPN".

Also note that this is really for internal RFC1918 addresses.  For this 
reason we also need to know where the office is located with latitude and
longitude.  You can use Google Maps to get this information down to a 
street level.
