For our BMC Remedy customers we’ve implemented Splunk solutions to fit their application management needs. Leveraging the power of Splunk to collect data from all tiers of the BMC Remedy platform we develop a Splunk solution around the most important data needs of the Remedy admin team. In some cases we’ve leveraged DBConnect to collect critical data from within the Remedy applications that is currently difficult to monitor and manage. Some of the areas of focus may include the following:

- AR Server performance monitoring (search performance, which users are running the longest running searches, top forms searched, etc.)
- Error and issue monitoring of all tiers of the Remedy application
- User activity and license usage
- Notification activity and issues
- CMDB reconciliation activity and errors
- Mid tier performance and errors
- AR Plugin monitoring
- AR Report performance monitoring
- Ease of troubleshooting workflow issues (filter and escalation) when they occur

WARNING: High volume logs created by ARS deployed to MS Windows will result in a multitude of duplicate events in Splunk due to the way Windows writes the log file. We are working with Splunk on a solution, in the meantime, please contact us for consultation on a work around.
