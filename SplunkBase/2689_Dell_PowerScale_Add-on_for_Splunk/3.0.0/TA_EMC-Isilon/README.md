## REQUIREMENTS

- Dell Isilon cluster with any one of oneFS versions among 9.4.x, 9.3.x, 9.2.x, 9.1.x, 9.0.x
- If using a forwarder, it must be a HEAVY forwarder(we use the HF because the universal forwarder does not include python)
- The forwarder system must have network access (HTTPS) to one or more Isilon nodes which are to be Splunked.
- Admin user ID and password for collecting data from the Isilon node.

## RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

- Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the [Splunk Enterprise system requirements](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) apply.

## TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

  - This app has been distributed in two parts.
    1. Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk, which gathers data from Dell Isilon platform.
    2. Dell PowerScale App for Splunk, which uses data collected by Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk, runs searches on it and builds dashboard using indexed data.
  - This App can be set up in two ways:
    1. Standalone Mode:
        - Here both the apps reside on a single machine.
        - Install the Dell PowerScale App for Splunk and Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk on a single machine.
        - The Dell PowerScale App for Splunk uses the data collected by Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk and builds the dashboard on it.
    2. Distributed Environment:
        - On Search Head, install both App and Add-on, and configure Add-on on the Search Head.
        - On Forwarder, install and configure Add-on, and create index manually on Indexer.
        - On Indexer, Create index from menu Settings->Indexes->New. Give the name of index (for eg. isilon), which has been used in Add-on on forwarder system.
        - Execute the following command on forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
       $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
        - On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
        - Dell PowerScale App for Splunk on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

### UPGRADE TA from version 2.2 to version 2.3

Follow below steps to upgrade Dell Isilon Technology addon from version 2.2 to 2.3
- Download tar of Dell Isilon Technology addon from splunk base (v2.3)
- Extract tar of Dell Isilon Technology addon under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Execute upgrade python script under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/bin/upgrade_from_v2.2_to_v2.3.py. On execution, the      script will ask for input and the user has to provide already setup nodes as comma-separated value.
  for eg. $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/bin/upgrade_from_v2.2_to_v2.3.py
  User can verify configured nodes from $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/local/passwords.conf
  This script will add stanza for each node in given list in file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/local/isilonappsetup.conf. Verify entry for each node in this file
- Restart Splunk 

## CONFIGURATION

- After fresh installation, Click on Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk from the Splunk Home page and you will be redirected to Configuration Page.
- To use the proxy, go to the Proxy tab in the Configuration section and provide the required details. Don't forget to check the Enable option.
- To configure the Log Level, go to the Logging tab.
- To configure the PowerScale Cluster, provide the below required details in the 'Cluster Node' tab:
    - Name: An unique name for the cluster node.
    - IP Address: IP Address for cluster node without scheme.
    - Username: Username for particular cluster node.
    - Password: Password for particular cluster node.
    - Index: Index in which you want to collect the data.
    - Verify SSL Certificate: Checkbox to verify your SSL Certificate if you are collecting data over encrypted network.
- If all the details are correct, a Cluster Node account will be created.
- Corresponding to above account, multiple inputs will be created as soon as cluster node details gets saved successfully.
- Those inputs will be in disabled mode by default and can be enabled from Inputs page. (Not required if you are on Search Head in distributed environment.)

- To enable forwarding syslog data in any Isilon Cluster version, perform the following steps:

  1. Make following changes in file /etc/mcp/override/syslog.conf (copy from /etc/mcp/default/syslog.conf if not present):
      - Put @<forwarders_ip_address> in front of the required log file and !* at the end of the syslog.conf file.
      - Restart syslogd using this command - /etc/rc.d/syslogd restart.

      - In some cases, syslog.conf file is already placed at /etc/mcp/override directory location but it is empty. In that case,  just put the log file name and the forwarder ip in that file. Below is the content of sample syslog.conf:
        ```
          auth.*    @<forwarders_ip_address>
          !audit_config
          *.*    @<forwarders_ip_address>
          !audit_protocol
          *.*    @<forwarders_ip_address>
          !*
        ```
  2. Run the following commands to enable protocol, config and syslog auditing according to Isilon OneFS version:

      - For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 9.x.x:
        ```
          isi audit settings global modify --protocol-auditing-enabled Yes
          isi audit settings global modify --config-auditing-enabled Yes
          isi audit settings global modify --config-syslog-enabled Yes
          isi audit settings modify --syslog-forwarding-enabled Yes
        ```

- Enable receiving the syslog data at forwarder. To do that, go to Settings -> Data Inputs -> UDP -> New. Provide the port number(514 is recommended by Splunk), sourcetype as emc:isilon:syslog and index same as provided in setup form of TA for same isilon cluster to this data input entry.  
- Make sure while receiving syslogs on you have set following metadata - index=Name of index, same as defined in above UDP data input, sourcetype=emc:isilon:syslog.

### Inputs Configuration

- Go to Inputs page. 
- Created inputs for particular Cluster Node can be seen in disabled mode with all the fields.
- Enable the inputs for which you want to collect the data.
- To create a new input, click on 'Create New Input' tab and provide the below required details:
    - Name: An unique name for the input.
    - Interval: Time after which input gets executed again. By default it is 3600 seconds. Minimum: 60 seconds and Maximum: 86400 seconds.
    - Index: Index in which you want to collect the data.
    - Cluster Node: Cluster Node for which you want to collect the data.
    - Endpoint: Endpoint for which data needs to be collected.

## EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES

We are using Dell Isilon API for data collection purpose.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

- General checks:
    - Note that all log files of this Add-on will be generated in `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/` directory.
    - Check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ta_emc_isilon_*.log or user can search `index="_internal" source=*ta_emc_isilon_*.log` query to see all the logs in UI. Also, user can use `index="_internal" source=*ta_emc_isilon_*.log ERROR` query to see ERROR logs in the Splunk UI.
    - To get the detailed logs, in the Splunk UI, navigate to `Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk`. Click on Configuration and go to the Logging tab. Select the Log level to DEBUG and save it.

- If data is not getting collected:
    - To check whether data is getting collected or not, run this search:
        - isilon_index | stats count by sourcetype
    - In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
        - emc:isilon:rest
        - emc:isilon:syslog
    - For "emc:isilon:syslog":
        - Check the syslog file in /etc/mcp/override/syslog.conf - it should have @<forwarders_ip_address> in front of the required log file and !* at the end of the syslog.conf file. Also run following command to see whether the syslog forwarding is enabled or not:
          1. For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 9.x.x - isi audit settings view, isi audit settings global view
        - Dell Isilon forward syslog and audit logs on 514 udp port by default. Please make sure port 514 is open and available for Isilon syslogs.
    - Disable/Enable the input to recollect the data.
    - Check the logs. They will be more verbose and will give the user insights on data collection.

## SAMPLE EVENT GENERATOR

- The TA_EMC-Isilon, comes with sample data files, which can be used to generate sample data for testing. In order to generate sample data, it requires SA-Eventgen application.  
- The TA will generate sample data of rest api calls and syslog at an interval of 10 minutes. You can update this configuration from eventgen.conf file available under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/default/.

## DISABLE ADD-ON

To disable the Add-on, you must be logged in to Splunk as an Administrator and follow the steps below.
  - Go to 'Manage Apps' from Splunk's home page.
  - In the search box, type the name of the add-on, and then click Search. In the Status column, next to Add-on, click Disable.

## UNINSTALL ADD-ON
- Uninstalling from a Standalone Environment
    - Disable the Add-on from the Splunk user interface as detailed above.
    - Log in to the Splunk machine from the backend and delete the Add-on folders. The add-on and its directory are typically located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<appname>.
    - Verify that no local configuration files related to Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk are available in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/users folders. If the local folder is present, remove it as well.
    - Restart Splunk

- Uninstalling from a distributed or clustered environment
    - In a cluster or distributed environment, the Dell PowerScale App for Splunk is installed on all the Search Heads and the Dell PowerScale Add-on for Splunk is installed on Search Heads and Forwarders.
    - The steps to uninstall the App and Add-on are the same as for Standalone.
    - To perform any installation or uninstallation step on all the search nodes of a distributed environment, use a deployer manager.
    - From the deployer machine, go to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/cluster/apps and remove the App and Add-on folders and execute the luster bundle command. [Refer](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/PropagateSHCconfigurationchanges)
