# See savedsearches.conf.spec in this app that defines these two keys.  
# In Splunk if you extend the conf key space like that,  you also need to 
# put these empty keys here in default, in the same app as the conf.spec
# file.  If you do not have these empty keys defined here, (or keys in default 
# specifying some value),  then when later your app tries to create or edit a 
# savedsearch and it submits values for these keys, splunk will throw the values away.
#
# TL;DR If you take these away then extended keys defined in 
# savedsearches.conf.spec, do not work properly in the REST API.
