1.6.1  (May 16th, 2018)
> App is renamed from "ObserveIT Connector" to "Insider Threat Connector" 
  in order to accommodate a request from ObserveIT that we no longer use 
  their trademark in this product's name.
> Update to workaround a regression in Splunk's "ServerSideInclude" module, 
  that would display an erroneous error message on the homepage for newer 
  versions of Splunk Enterprise.

1.6  (November 26th, 2018)
> Default licensing is now the Sideview Free Internal Use License Agreement.

1.5.1  (March 26th, 2018)
> Fixed a problem where the error messages were not appearing correctly to 
  alert admins if Sideview Utils was not installed, or was too low a version.
> Workaround for a bug in Splunk where the server returns "UNKNOWN_VERSION" as
  the Splunk version. Prior to this release of the app, when his bug did occur 
  in Splunk it made the app's version dependency check fail, and then redirect 
  every user to the homepage to tell them the Splunk version was too low. 

1.5 (August 18th, 2017)
> Added Login as a top level filtering pulldown on the Browse Sessions and 
  General Report pages.
> Increased required version of Splunk from 5.0 to 6.0. 
> reduced the vertical padding on the form fields in Browse and Report
> Fixed a bug where on smaller window sizes, the Search Controls could appear 
  jumbled on top of the Tabs.
> Integrated the oit_alerts sourcetype into the Browse Sessions and Session 
  Detail views, as well as into the General Report interface.
> Modified the oit_alerts sourcetypes to fix various problems due to there 
  being spaces in the field names. Note - this is an index-time change so 
  if you have already been indexing the Alerts data as sourcetype="oit_alerts"
  the old data won't work with this version. 
> Cleaned up the duration fields to trim off the redundant zeros after 
  decimal points that were appearing on some rows.
> Added a health check so that if one of the two required sourcetypes are not 
  indexed, it lights up a helpful error on the homepage. 
> Added a health check so that if one of the two required sourcetypes aren't 
  getting their fields extracted properly, it lights up a helpful error on 
  the homepage
> Added checklist.conf stanzas,  so that we have some healthchecks running in 
  DMC,  so overall deployment admins can get a sense of whether the app is 
  set up and running well.

1.4  (May 25th, 2017)
> Removed the Field Picker that we added in 1.3,  but instead the Browse UI 
  has been broadened to allow browsing not only sessions but also rollups by 
  Server, User, Client, Domain, Command, Application.  Drilling down into any 
  of these causes the Browse view to filter to that value and flip back to 
  browsing sessions.
> The breadcrumb link from Session Detail back to browse now restores 
  whatever search filters had been active on the Browse page previously.
> Application and Command pulldowns now have a way to search for sessions
  that have no value at all for the given field.
> Fixed a bug when drilling down into the homepage's "top 10" chart, where 
  the values for Login, User, Server and Client names would all be blank.
  Fixed the same bug in the Activity Dashboard drilldowns.
> Fixed a bug where saved report clicks were loading in Splunk's generic 
  Report view instead of the app's report view.
> Added Create Dashboard and Create Alert buttons to the Browse view.
> Homepage Chart now offers group by and also split-by field choices, and
  defaults to top Users split by Server.
> 

1.3  (November 11th, 2016)
> Condensed the design on Session Detail so Application and Command level 
  details are now in a single shared column.
> On Session Detail, there is now a second Pager module below the main table.
> DomainName is no longer a top level pulldown on Browse Sessions.
> Command and CommandInvocation are now defined in conf rather than in macros
> Removed multiselect Pulldowns in favor of newer Sideview CheckboxPulldown 
  modules in Browse Sessions. 
> Modified behavior of Application and Command pulldowns in Browse Sessions 
  so that sessions are now returned with either the specified Applications or 
  the specified Commands.
> Renamed "report" view to "general_report" to no longer prevent use of the 
  generic Splunk "report" view that ships in 6.X.
> Browse Sessions now has a Field Picker you can use to add/remove and reorder
  the fields shown in the table. 
> Browse Sessions now has "see full search syntax" link and a "graph sessions
  over time" link.   The latter serves as a crosslink to send the given 
  sessions over into "General Report"
> Browse Sessions now has a time and a new "duration" field instead of the old 
  "began" and "ended" fields.  Duration values look like "00:01:23"


1.2.2  (October 26, 2016)
> Fixed a mistake in our indexes.conf that had windows-style backslashes in 
  the paths. 
> Added the indexes.conf config to the TA app. 
> Fixed a bug where the icons and links to view the slides from the Session 
  Detail page had stopped working. 

1.2.1  (June 30th, 2016)
> Added TA_observeit app,  for deployment to any forwarding tier or indexing 
  tier. Going forward the full observeit app should only be on Search Heads.

1.2  (April 4th, 2016)
> Added sourcetype config for "oit_logins", "oit_sessions", "oit_conf_changes"

1.1
> Substantial fixes around how the app was detecting Sideview Utils, so that 
  this detection can work on Splunk 6.X.  
> By default the app now expects data to be indexed into index="observeit"

1.0.1
> Updated the app to workaround issues in Splunk 5.0 around saved search names
  in "@go" URLs.  This app now requires at least Sideview Utils 2.2.4. 
  See release notes for Sideview Utils 2.2.4.

1.0
> added a workflow action for the ViewerURL, so that people can jump to the
  video quickly if they're ever browsing the raw events.
> added a SEDCMD at indextime to replace \, (ie backslash+comma) with two 
  backslashes and a comma. 
> fixed a bug where misc. search terms were not being used in the report view.

0.9
> moved custom dashboard css out into a separate file. 
> updated dashboard css to work correctly on IE. (although without rounded 
  corners)
> updated macro that creates began/ended fields in such a way that they 
  remain sortable.
> fixed initial sort order on browse_sessions

0.8
> Fixing a bug where the session_detail table would look clickable. 
> adding new fields to the 3 session list tables, and normalizing them all. 
> pulling various pieces of session_list functionality into macros.
> passing selected Application/Command values from browse_session into 
  session_detail
> Added better 'save' menus and job controls, export, print controls. 
> added not just save but 'create dashboard', 'create alert' controls to the 
  general report builder.

0.7
> passing along filter args to the session_detail view. 
> fixing a bug where session table clicks died once you clicked a video icon
> normalizing the 'other' and 'misc terms' field labels to 'misc terms'
> passing on the selected pie wedge to the session_detail.xml
> Fixing problems in the merge_applications_and_commands macros.conf. This 
  fixed many bugs where VALUE would appear, or the applications and commands 
  values would be off. 
> put a limit=5 into the session_detail timechart so the 6th-10th items dont
  get confusingly clipped from the legend.
> fixed a bug where pie wedge selection would remain even after restarting 
  from the top. 

0.6
> made session_detail display both commands and applications in the timechart, 
  and also made it stack. 
> added OS pulldown to browse_sessions and report view. 
> in browse_sessions, merged the Applications and Commands columns into one 
  column called "Applications/Commands"
> updated the regex that cleans up the Command field, and that creates the 
  CommandInvocation field, to not 
  leave a space character in the 'Command' values. 
> fixed a typo in the fillnull_commands macro that wasn't filling null values 
  of ApplicationName
> added a "sort-by" pulldown that appears in the report view when appropriate. 
> Fixed a problem where all the little counts wrapped in parentheses, across 
  all the pulldowns, were reporting the wwrong numbers. Fixed these to 
  indicate the number of sessions that contain the given value.
> filtered out the problematic "N/A" values from Application and Command 
  pulldowns. 
> customized the "command" clicks in the dashboard view, to append "*".
