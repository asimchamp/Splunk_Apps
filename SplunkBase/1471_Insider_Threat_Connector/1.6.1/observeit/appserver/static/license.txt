TRIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
This Trial License Agreement is a legal agreement between you (the "Licensee") and Sideview, LLC, ("Licensor" or "Sideview").  Licensor has created a number of Splunk Apps (the "Software") which run on top of the Splunk Server.  By using the Software, you accept these terms and agree to be bound by the terms of this Trial License Agreement (the "TLA").  This TLA applies to any and all versions of all Sideview Apps provided on a Trial basis.  All such products, individually and collectively, are subject to this TLA.  
PLEASE READ THIS TLA CAREFULLY; IT HAS LICENSE TERMS WITH WHICH YOU MAY BE UNFAMILIAR.
If Licensee is a corporation, partnership or similar entity, then the Software license granted under this TLA is expressly conditioned upon acceptance of the TLA by a person who is authorized to sign for and bind the entity.  If you are not authorized to sign for and bind the entity, then do not download, install or use the Software.  If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this TLA, terminate the download or install process, do not use the Software, and promptly return the Software and any accompanying items to the entity from which you obtained them.

1.  Software.  This TLA sets forth Licensee's rights in the Software made available through Licensor's Sideview web site, or on Splunk.com or websites operated by Splunk.com or otherwise attached to or connected with this TLA, which are collectively referred to as the "Software," as well as any accompanying user instructions, manuals or other materials, and online help files regarding the use of the Software, if any, that may be provided by Sideview in connection with the Software ("Documentation.")

2.  Grant of License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this TLA, Sideview hereby grants to Licensee a limited, nonexclusive and nontransferable license to (a) use, configure and modify the Software for its own internal information processing services and computing needs in its business as currently conducted and (b) use the Documentation, if any, in connection with use of the Software.  Sideview hereby reserves all rights to the Software, Documentation, or any copyrights, patents, or trademarks, or Confidential Information, as defined below, any other intellectual property of any nature embodied or used in connection therewith, except for the rights expressly granted herein.  Licensee may make a reasonable number of machine-readable copies of the Software for backup or archival purposes.  Licensee shall not copy the Software, except as permitted by this TLA.  Licensee shall maintain accurate and up-to-date records of the number and location of all copies of the Software and inform Sideview in writing of such location upon request.  All copies of the Software will be subject to all terms and conditions of this TLA.  Whenever Licensee is permitted to copy or reproduce all or any part of the Software, Licensee shall reproduce and not efface any and all titles, trademark symbols, copyright symbols and legends, and other proprietary markings on the Software.

3.  License Restrictions.  Licensee shall abide by the following restrictions as applicable.  

(a) Trial License.  The rights granted hereunder are for a 90 day trial period only.  Sideview grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to install and use one copy of the Software on a single computer, device, workstation, terminal, or other digital electronic or analog device ("Device") solely to use the Software on a trial basis.  Upon expiration of the permitted time period, Licensee's rights under this License terminate and Licensee must remove and destroy all copies and any components thereof from your Device.  If Licensee desires to use the Software after the completion of the permitted time period specified in (b) below of this Trial License, Licensee will need to acquire a valid, non-trial license to the Software.  As an alternative to the rights granted above, Licensee may store or install the Software on a storage Device, such as a network server, used only to install or run the Software on a single computer over an internal network within Licensee's organization for Trial Usage during the time period identified in (b) below of this Trial License.  A license for the Software may not be shared or used concurrently on different Devices.  
(b)  Permitted Time Period.  LICENSEE'S RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE LICENSEE FIRST INSTALLS ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE ON ANY DEVICE AND SHALL CONTINUE FOR A PERIOD OF NINETY (90) DAYS, AT WHICH TIME LICENSEE'S RIGHTS SHALL CEASE.  NOTICE OF EXPIRATION MAY NOT BE GIVEN, SO LICENSEE MUST PLAN FOR THE EXPIRATION DATE.  If you desire to use the Software after your trial is completed, you will need to acquire a validly licensed copy of the Software.  
(c) Reservation of Rights.  Sideview reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this Trial License.  
(d) Support.  Any support provided by Sideview in connection with Trial Usage shall continue only for the 90 day trial period, after which time period further support shall be provided pursuant to a mutually acceptable Services Agreement.  
(e).  Termination.  Without prejudice to any other rights, Sideview may terminate this Trial License if Licensee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Trial License.  In such event, You must destroy all copies of the Product and all of its component parts.  
(f)  As-Is.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this TLA,  all Software subject to such license is delivered "AS-IS," without any express or implied warranties, and no warranties or maintenance obligations will apply to Sideview.  Sideview HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SOFTWARE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SOFTWARE.

4.  Proprietary Rights.  This TLA transfers to Licensee neither title nor any proprietary or intellectual property rights to any of the Software, Documentation, or any copyrights, patents, or trademarks, embodied or used in connection therewith, except for the rights expressly granted herein.  The Software and Documentation, in whole and in part and all copies thereof, are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Licensor.  All rights not expressly granted are hereby reserved to Licensor.  Upon installation and use of the Software tracking information consisting of the name of the app, page names and version numbers will be sent to sideview apps.  Licensee consents to such data gathering for Sideview's internal purposes only.

5.  Support and Maintenance.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this TLA will govern any Software updates and upgrades that may be provided to Licensee unless such updates and upgrades are provided under separate license agreement.

6.  No Warranty and Disclaimer.  Sideview makes no warranty that the Software will perform as intended by Licensee.  The Software may contain errors, be incomplete, may not be reliable or error free.  If during the trial period the Software does not perform, Sideview may at its option, correct the Software or, replace such Software.  Except as set forth above, Sideview makes no warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory regarding or relating to the Software or the Documentation provided to Licensee under this TLA.  SIDEVIEW HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

7.  Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL SIDEVIEW BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF SIDEVIEW HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  SIDEVIEW'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS TLA FOR DAMAGES WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY LICENSEE.  The provisions of this Section 7 allocate risks under this TLA between Licensee and Sideview.  Sideview's pricing of the Software reflects this allocation of risks and limitation of liability.
8.  Confidential Information.  "Confidential Information" means all Software, Documentation, information, data, specifications, trade secrets, object code and machine-readable copies of the Software, source code relating to the Software, and any other proprietary information supplied to Licensee by Sideview.  Licensee agrees not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this TLA.  Licensee agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information to third parties or to such party's employees, except to those employees of the Licensee with a need to know.  Licensee shall not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects that embody Confidential Information or modifying or editing Confidential Information for commercial gain other than as allowed under this TLA.  Licensee shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information.  Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information and shall ensure that its employees who have access to Confidential Information have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions hereof, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees.  Licensee shall reproduce the other party's proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.

9.  Termination.  Upon termination the following Sections will survive any termination of this TLA: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.  No later than thirty (30) days after the date of termination or discontinuance of this TLA for any reason whatsoever, Licensee shall return the Software and all copies, in whole or in part, all Documentation relating thereto, and any other Confidential Information in its possession that is in tangible form.  Licensee shall furnish Sideview with a certificate signed by an executive officer of Licensee verifying that the same has been done.

10.  Miscellaneous
10.1 Nonassignment/Binding Agreement.  Neither this TLA nor any rights under this TLA may be assigned or otherwise transferred by Licensee, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of Sideview which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  Subject to the foregoing, this TLA will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

10.3 Limitation on Claims.  No action arising out of any breach or claimed breach of this TLA or transactions contemplated by this TLA may be brought by either party more than one year after the cause of action has accrued.  For purposes of this TLA, a cause of action will be deemed to have accrued when a party knew or reasonably should have known of the breach or claimed breach.
10.4 Force Majeure.  Neither party will incur any liability to the other party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this TLA if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the control and without negligence of the parties.  Such events, occurrences, or causes will include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, earthquake, fire and explosions, but the inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.
10.5 Waiver.  Any waiver of the provisions of this TLA or of a party's rights or remedies under this TLA must be in writing to be effective.  Failure, neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this TLA or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed and will not be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this TLA and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this TLA or prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.  No exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this TLA will preclude the enforcement by such party of any other right or remedy under this TLA or that such party is entitled by law to enforce.
10.6 Severability.  If any term, condition, or provision in this TLA is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to agree to such amendments that will preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this TLA.  If the parties fail to agree on such an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
10.7 Integration.  This TLA contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this TLA and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  This TLA may not be amended, except by a writing signed by both parties.
10.8 Purchase Orders.  No terms, provisions or conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement or other business form that Licensee may use in connection with the acquisition or licensing of the Software will have any effect on the rights, duties or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise modify, this TLA, regardless of any failure of Sideview to object to such terms, provisions or conditions.
10.9 Export.  Licensee may not export or re-export the Software without the prior written consent of Sideview and without the appropriate United States and foreign government licenses.
10.10 Governing Law.  This TLA will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles.
