			<h1>Running your First SplunkWeb Search</h1>
			<p>Now that you have a SCOM Dashboard containing the SplunkWeb widget, 
			you are ready to run a search.  In this example, we will execute a simple search that 
			summarizes records pulled from Windows Event Logs.</p>
			<p>To execute the example search:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open the Splunk dashboard view created earlier in this 
				introductory tutorial.  The dashboard will automatically 
				authenticate with the configured SplunkWeb portal and display 
				a Splunk search app.</li>
				<li>Once the Splunk search app appears in the dashboard view, 
				find the search query field near the top of the SplunkWeb user interface.</li>
				<li>Enter this query into the search query field: 
				<span class='query'>sourcetype=WinEventLog:*|stats count by source</span></li>
				<li>Click on the Search button to execute the search.  The SplunkWeb 
				search app will update with results.

				</li>
