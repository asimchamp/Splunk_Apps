        <span class="head4">Description: </span>
        <span class="bodytext">Determine which events are compatible with a semantic query. An event is compatible with the query if the compatibility index (xcix) is greater than the alfacut.  The default alfacut is 0.2. If an event meets this condition, it is written to the output stream with the value of the xcix added as a field named by cixname. The default is "WhereCIX". If not, the event is disposed. The xcix is generated using one of two functions, avg or weighted. The avg function sums the membership values of each query and divides by the count. The weighted function is similar to a weighted average. The xcix is calculated by putting a higher value on memberhip in terms that are closer to the beginning of the query, and then divides by the weighted count. Since the xcix is added to each event that meets the alfacut, other commands can then be applied to generate more intelligent information.</span>

        <span class="explanation">The compatibility query. The query is structured as follows: field [FROM context] [IN container] [BY class] IS [hedge]* set. The field must be one of the fields in the event. The context, container, and class is optional.  If a context is not specified, the query uses a context of the same name as the field. If a container is not specified, the query uses a container of the same name as the context. A hedge can be one or more of the following: above, after, before, below, close extremely, generally, not, positively, slightly, somewhat, very, vicinity. The set is the name of a set in the context.  </span>
