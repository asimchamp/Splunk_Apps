${_('The Splunk for FAA App comes prebuilt with saved searches and dashboards that are used to work on archived flights provided by the FAA. <br/>All the hard work for configuring timestamps has already been done for you.  All that is left for you to do is to index the data provided online.<br/>')}
</p>


<p>
<strong>Here is how you index the data:</strong>

<ol>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time">http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time</a></li>
	<li>Select which month of data you wish to index via the dropdown lists</li>
	<li>Check Prezipped File (Note that this App has been configured to only recognize data that includes all the fields made available)</li>
	<li>Click Download and Unzip Your File</li>
	<li>Now go to the Splunk indexer via Manager>Data Inputs>Add data>From files and directories>Skip Preview</li>
	<li>Select "Upload and index a file" and select the unzipped .csv file</li>
	<li><strong>Important: </strong>Click on more settings and select manual from Source Type. Enter in "airline_csv" without the quotes</li>
	<li>Click save and after a few minutes, your data will be indexed correctly!</li>
	<li>Return to the FAA App and the dashboards and saved searches will now populate with data</li>
	<li>If you choose to, you can index more data from different months but note that your searches will become slow as this is a huge dataset.  Use the TimeRange picker to adjust what time range of data you want to search on to improve performance</li>
</ol>

Alternatively, you can put the unzipped .csv files in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/FAA/flightdata/ and the application will automatically start indexing the data for you.
<br/>
If you don't want to manually download the files, you can also run faascript.py located in the same folder.  It will download and extract a range of files for you.
Here is how to run it: <b>python faascript.py 1/2011 2/2012</b> (Note: only tested on unix systems.) This will download all files from January 2011 to February 2012 into that folder and splunk will start indexing them.
You can also just provide one date to download just one month of data. If this method does not work, just manually download the files and follow the steps above.
