0.6
-----
* Abstracted the output transport logic out into verticles.  
So you can choose from STDOUT (default for Modular Inputs) or bypass this and output
data to Splunk over other transports ie: TCP.  
This also makes it easy to add other output transports  in the future.  
Futhermore , this makes the implementation of custom data handlers much cleaner as you don't have worry about output transport logic or formatting Modular Input Stream XML for STDOUT transports.
