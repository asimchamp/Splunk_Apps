description = Free Windows Network User Accounting (FWNUA) is a small open source utility run inside of a windows login script to collect information about login events and forward them to splunk from individual workstations.  It collects Username, Computername, IP Address, Logon Domain, Time/Date, and the Logon Status (on|off).  Data is sent to Splunk via syslog messages.  Once there, a powerfull dashboard can help decipher user login event information.
