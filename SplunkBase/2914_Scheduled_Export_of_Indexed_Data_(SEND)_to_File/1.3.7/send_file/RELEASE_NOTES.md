# Scheduled Export of Indexed Data (SEND) to File

1.3.7
-----
* general updates to meet latest Cloud Vetting requirements

1.3.6
-----
* removed setup.xml because since Splunk 8.1 it does not seem to work (although it is permitted for Modular Alerts to have a setup.xml file), it just endlessly loops back on itself and writes no configuration settings, hence the App can't escape a "not yet configured" state. Replaced with a custom HTML setup form.
